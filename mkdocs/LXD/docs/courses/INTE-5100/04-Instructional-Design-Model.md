Instructional Design Model

For this design solution, we are applying various design models, including:

ADDIE

(Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate)

Design Thinking

(Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test)

Human-Centered Design

(Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation)

However, we are utilizing the ADDIE model as our instructional design backbone, Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate. We chose the ADDIE model as it is a well-known and industry-recognized model. It was our hope, in keeping with the familiar, that we could help stakeholders better understand our departures into new models (eLearning Industry, 2020).

Early on, we felt our learning design needed to address the human element, as our identified gaps included learner detachment. To do so we incorporated Design Thinking with the mindset of Human-Centered Design (HCD).

Design thinking is a 5-step process that would overlay Human-Centered design thinking. Human-Centered Design utilizes two modes of thinking, convergent and divergent. When designing a learning experience, both modes of thinking place the learner at the center. Convergent thinking is logical and seeks to answer questions. While divergent thinking seeks to create ideas by asking new questions. By combining Design Thinking — which places the learner at the center of the design process — and Human-Centered Design, we ended up with the model shown in Figure 1: Using Human-Centered Design with Design Thinking (MovingWorlds, 2018).

To break down our design process, we will summarize our steps through the context of the ADDIE model. When additional instructional design models are used, we will note actions taken in each ADDIE phase. As additional instructional design models may not be one-to-one inline with ADDIE, best efforts will be taken to correlate their relationships.

(Interviews, Survey)

As we entered the analysis phase, we needed to better understand our learners and their knowledge gaps; therefore, we expanded ADDIE’s analysis phase to incorporate additional instructional design models to better connect with our learners. We conducted interviews, and surveyed the field of adult education, providing us with a human connection. Through utilizing Human-Centered Design techniques early on, we discovered problems and gaps that might have gone unnoticed.

One such example is the solution name itself, Student Ambassadors. While reviewing the survey results, it turns out over half of the adult educators have negative connotations with a program by that name. We also discovered the name to be a point of confusion during the interview process, since the solution design is targeting adult educators, not students. To correct this newly discovered problem, we adjusted the solution design name to Ambassador Leaders. The name is ambiguous to allow any participant to be recognized as a leader.

Developing learner personas illuminated the complexity and diversity of our learners. It also helped us to define the knowledge and skills gaps that our students need to have met.

During this iterative process, we reflected on our learning goal and our identified problems and learning gaps and proceeded to create learning objectives. During the same time, we also brought in a human element and started to structure a learning path through our proposed learning solution.

Considering the wide array of learning gaps and problems uncovered during our analysis, we attempted to design a solution that would be adaptable while meeting the organization’s initial needs. It was here that we expanded the ADDIE design phase to include Design Thinking. While using the Design Thinking model, we iterated between the Define and Ideate phase allowing us to create a fuller more robust solution, than what might have been possible. Mixing this with a Human-Centered Design mindset, we spent time considering the impacts of the solution for both the learner and the organization (Appendix 1).

Based on the problems and learning gaps we identified in the Analysis phase, learning objectives were revised during the design phase to better align with the desired outcomes for the Ambassador Leaders program. During this revision, appropriate objective-aligned assessments were designed.

A primary outcome for the Ambassador Leaders program looks to support Colorado Adult Educators through building a professional learning community while also engaging the field in advocacy efforts. A challenge in the advocacy effort is the competing National Student Ambassadors program which was found to have negative connotations. We designed around this problem, through a name change, in the analysis phase and considered this important factor while planning the learners’ journey. Through an outreach campaign, we decided we could build learner awareness of the program goals and professional learning opportunities. We also realized outreach would support the need for transparency and reporting successes of an advocacy program desired by the field. We, therefore, placed it at multiple points in the program design creating a circular process, solving multiple needs through thoughtful communication with the field.

With low Adult Educator professional development opportunities available in Colorado, providing meaningful professional development was a natural next step. With the diversity of professional learning needs in the field, we had to design a flexible learning environment, which also respected the learner’s busy schedules. We thought of the idea of courses structured around microlearning experiences would best address this need. We then dove-tailed the courses with forums to build a professional learning community, a need consistently expressed by our learners. Therefore, the collaborative peer forum will be used to facilitate community and communication. Without a behavior change, professional learning makes no difference. Therefore, once the direct instruction and collaborative process have been completed, learners must go out into their contexts and implement their new knowledge and strategies.

Finally, the long-term successes of learners implementing their newly gained knowledge will be celebrated. This will be documented and used to spread awareness of the Ambassador Leader program and advocate for Colorado Adult Education, leading back to the initial need.

Develop

Within the development phase, we focused on a microlearning experience. We practiced the use of storyboarding and thought about the human element of how learners would progress through professional learning.

Development of the program microlearning experiences will be driven by the specific learning objectives created during the Design phase and tied initially to the professional learning identified in the Adult Educator Survey. We storyboarded a course exemplifying a leveled course structure building from a base idea to the program goal of implementing high-impact practices into instruction (Appendix 1). This will be a format for course development.

As we have provided a high-level objective for professional learning, additional learning objectives will be embedded in the microlearning courses to inform the learning within the courses. The microlearning courses and community forums are the heart of the Ambassador Leaders program and are the intended professional learning opportunities and professional community that will be continuously developed.

Implement

The implementation phase will be when learners participate in the learning experience. We have detailed a Beta cycle for implementation and guidelines are outlined in the Schedule. Within the schedule have laid out milestones and mapped out a timeline to implement a beta program cycle. This could be considered a test run using a minimal viable project (MVP) for the first iteration.

During the iterative process of the design phase, we considered the high-level learning objectives for the Ambassador Leaders program, we also considered the assessment and evaluation for each phase. We have aligned the assessments to the New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM) in a blended assessment form. A blended model consists of multiple assessment strategies used to reach any one level of NWKM. The evaluation process was designed thinking about how each phase is a stepping stone to the next phase of learning, to lead the learner through the program.

Evaluation data will be analyzed and used to refine the Ambassador Leader program. In analyzing the evaluation data, NWKM Level 1 will lead to Level 4. We have provided an evaluation schedule and plan for communication (Evaluation Plan).
