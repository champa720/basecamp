Schedule

For scheduling, we created a Beta Release timeline and designed program milestones. We then condensed this information into project milestones for a successful Beta Release. We also outlined a project timeline for the Beta Release, aligned to each phase of the program. Below you will find a list of project milestones followed by a project timeline surrounding the completion of each project phase.

Project Timeline

The dates listed are dates of completion and are suggested timeframes for completion of each phase of the Beta Release. Once the initial implementation is completed, the process will be iterated on, to improve future training.

Project Milestones

We considered the project phases, steps, deliverables, and tasks to be completed, most outlined in our Journey Map (AppendixÂ 1). After the completion of the design document, the pre-release milestones are to be completed before learners enter Phase 1 of the Beta Release.

Pre-release
