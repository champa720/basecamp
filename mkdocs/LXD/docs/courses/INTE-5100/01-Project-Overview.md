# Project Overview

The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association (CAEPA) is an organization whose purpose is to support Adult Education programs within Colorado. It serves a diverse group of adult education programs such as community colleges, literacy programs, community initiatives, correctional programs, and nonprofits. CAEPA serves these programs through professional development, providing and sharing instructional resources, and advocacy for adult education.

CAEPA is facing many obstacles in the way of Coloradoâ€™s Adult Education. Some identified obstacles include: Adult Education programs suffer due to under-funding and resources, educators not being equipped with the skills of standards-based instruction, as well as, online/hybrid instructional and engagement strategies.

The purpose of this design document is to create and develop a Colorado Ambassador Leaders program. The Colorado Ambassador Leaders program will provide professional learning around instructional strategies and foster professional learning communities. Additionally, the program will develop teacher and student ambassadors for Adult Education advocacy. The Ambassador Leaders program will serve as a stepping stone for the sustainability and growth of Adult Education programs in Colorado.

> The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, CAEPA, provides leadership to the field of adult education and family literacy by offering opportunities for professional development, advocacy, and resource sharing to improve the quality of life for every Coloradan (Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, n.d., Mission Statement).
