Proposed Learning Solution

While considering the organization’s initial needs and mission and after conducting a broad analysis of the intended learners, we are proposing a robust learning solution to meet the needs of the organization and the learners they support. The solution will be a program called Ambassador Leaders and will address three overarching learning needs in Colorado Adult Education.

Development and support of Teacher & Student Ambassadors

Offering professional learning for Colorado Adult Educators

Fostering a supportive professional community

The solution will be a comprehensive program leading the learners through four-phases of learning, each phase contains one- or two-objectives. Professional learning and community are the heart of the solution and are designed to be highly flexible and expandable over time to meet the changing needs of adult education (Figure 2: Ambassador Leaders).

To best explain the learning solution, we will summarize the journey detailing the organization’s involvement and the learners’ journey (Appendix 1).

Phase 1: Prepare

During the first phase, the organization will be defining the program and explaining the opportunities contained within. This will be a marketing campaign aimed at recruiting participants and explaining the offerings that will be available during the next phase. Emphasis will be placed on (re) branding Ambassador Leaders — a program designed to support adult education through advocacy, professional learning, and a supportive network (Appendix 1). This will be an ongoing campaign, with new announcements released as new content becomes available, always reaffirming the goal of the program.

From the learners’ perspective, they will discover the vision of the program and will connect to the familiar aspect of professional learning the organization is known to provide, generating enthusiasm. Additionally, the learner will also build an understanding of the inherent advocacy aspect. The learner will be able to distinguish how Ambassador Leaders is in juxtaposition to the larger national Student Ambassador model. The dropping of the adjective “student” is intentional. By labeling all participants as “Ambassadors” the program will empower adult educators and will include programs and by proxy, student voices too. The broader definition of Ambassador Leaders will create a larger more sustainable community of advocates representing the diversity in Colorado Adult Education.

The conclusion of this phase will be when the learners register for the program. The primary goal of this phase is to inform the participants of the program’s advocacy effort and professional learning available.

Phase 2: Acquire Knowledge and Skills

This phase is the heart of the program and can be imagined as a series of microlearning courses, offering synchronous and asynchronous learning through a learning management system. Initially, the organization will be the primary content creators, building the library of professional learning available. Later, Industry experts including publishers and speakers will be sought out as content creators, as well as, contributors from the field and external stakeholders. The content will have a consistent build as there will be guidance provided as to the structure of each course.

Learning opportunities in this phase will have a subset of learning objectives to support the specific topic of instruction. Through the Adult Educator survey (Appendix 1), immediate training needs have been identified — surrounding online instructional strategies — and will be prioritized in the Beta Release. All topics of instruction will incorporate the use of a high impact practice (Appendix 1) to address the program goal. Basing the goal of the project on a flexible practice will string a common thread of learning throughout every offering in the Ambassador Leaders program while meeting the needs of the adult education field.

The learners will have ongoing access to the various contents within the platform. These skills and knowledge will be built around unique learning objectives and assessments for the microlearning course and will be accessible in the learning management system. Over time, each course will offer different levels of understanding similar to a course structure, 101, 201, 301, etc… By offering levels of content, or tiers, we are connecting to the learners’ intrinsic motivation by offering choice and meeting the learner where their skill level is at and honoring the diversity of the adult educators we serve – Adult Learning Theory.

Phase 3: Build Memory and Apply on the Job

Phase three of the solution intends to build a learner community and extend learning from the previous phase. This phase contains two-steps, one within the learning management system and the other externally in their workplace, respectively.

The first step will have the learners collaborate with other professionals within forums or in virtual breakout sessions. This will be a safe place to explore new ideas the learner picked up in the previous phase. Learner Persona 2 (Appendix 1) noted that their workplace environment is lacking in a supportive space to exchange and explore new instructional ideas, this step is designed to support this gap. Additionally, this space can provide discussions surrounding advocacy or other topics adult educators choose to start-up, informing future learning topics.

The second step will ask the learner to apply the new skills on the job, with an emphasis on trialing high impact practices. Learners will be able to fall back to the previous collaborative step to ask questions, seek guidance, or report successes.

From the organization perspective, the content creators will be fulfilling the role of moderators during the collaborative phase. Additionally, the organization will reach out to the learners to find out how things are going in their workplace. This will be a formative assessment and can be survey-based. The questions will be open-ended, with emphasis on reflection based answers, asking the learners about their experience in the Ambassador Leaders program this far and how they are applying the new information.

By providing learners a safe place to exchange ideas and asking for reflections about the impacts of new practices within their workplace, the Ambassador Leaders program will meet the learning objectives for this phase.

Phase 4: Maintain Use Over Time

To wrap up the program, we wanted to further connect the learners and outreach to new potential learners and content creators. This phase is about transparency, communication, and supporting the Ambassador Leaders program.

As part of the design, we wanted to recognize the work of Adult Educators. This could be considered a capstone project for the learners, representing a high impact practice. The organization will follow up with how the learner is applying the ideas gained through participating in Ambassador Leaders. This is in response to a critique we heard during our interview with Learner Persona 1 (Appendix 1). They expressed a desire to know how other programs are implementing ambassador ideas, their struggles, and their successes. During this phase, the organization will conduct interviews – student, educator, or program – and release it to the public, thus restarting the program phases.
