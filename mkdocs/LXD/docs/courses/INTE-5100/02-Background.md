# Background

As of this year, over half of Colorado’s Adult Education programs have been defunded (federal at a state decision) leaving over 4,500 Coloradans who had programs, without a program.

Colorado has identified 321,000 Adults lacking basic skills to advance in the workplace, and 126,000 Adults lacking basic English skills to advance (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020a).

All in Federal and State, an adult learner is supported by $838 compared to $10,000 in  elementary education (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020a).

## Funding

In 2014, Colorado was the last state in the union to receive state funding and has one of the lowest state contributions of one-million dollars (Wilson, 2014).

Colorado Adult Education is funded through two-streams of grant funding. One at the Federal level is called Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) — which lasts for 4-years.

The other is State funding called, Adult Education and Literacy Act (AELA) — which lasts for 3-years. Both grants are distributed through the Department of Education, Office of Adult Education Initiatives.

Colorado Senate Bill (SB20-009, 2020) was successfully advocated for in 2014 and again in 2020. The 2014 passage marked the year that Colorado began funding Adult Education. The following revision was signed into law on July 8, 2020, and provides an expansion of service providers and at the same funding level.

## Student Ambassadors

CAEPA is witnessing a decline in their Professional Development attendance and low involvement in advocacy campaigns, including Student Ambassadors.

CAEPA has participated in the Coalition on Adult Basic Education Student Ambassador campaigns for about 2 years (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020b) and has had little buy-in from the field. COABE has recently hired a part-time coordinator for its Student Ambassador program. However, their focus is on recruitment and preparation for civic engagement with elected officials. COABE does prepare all talking points at the Federal level and provides advocacy materials. They recently released an app that connects participants by regional areas.

## Professional Learning

The Colorado State Office of Adult Education Initiatives (AEI) has provided little professional development to the field. The Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE) who administers the Federal funds has issued the Department of Education a Corrective Action Plan (Appendix 1). In the plan, they made several recommendations for AEI, noting their lack of leadership and lack of professional development for the field.

In recent years, CAEPA has fulfilled the majority of the states required professional development, AEI noted this in their required FY Narrative Reports to OCTAE (National Reporting System, n.d.). Since the pandemic, AEI has provided links to distance learning platforms, however, this came around June/July of 2020 and was in conjunction with the office of K-12 (Colorado Department of Education, n.d.). They provided no guidance, limited training, and provided no practices to support educators during this time of transition.

As an example of poor guidance, AEI suggested proctoring the federally mandated standardized test to adult learners in their cars in empty parking lots, rather than provide training to implement online testing. However, AEI does have an online platform that has a Q&A forum with resources, and last checked is poorly maintained.

To support Colorado’s Adult Education professional development needs, CAEPA hosts an annual PD Conference every October. Over the years a decline in attendance has been tracked (Table 1).
