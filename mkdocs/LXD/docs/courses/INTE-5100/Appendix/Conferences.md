Conferences

CAEPA postponed Scheduling this yearâ€™s annual conference due to several reasons:

Program cuts - AEI defunded 1/2 of all adult ed programs on August 31, 2020.

AEFLA Funding: AEI initially released a timeline for the completion of the new AEFLA grant cycle and has not kept to it. The timeline has since been removed from the AEI Prospective Grantees page.

The current grant competition is still underway as of October 2020.

No determination of grantees has been announced.

No funds have been released.

AELA Funding: AELA Funding was uncertain as a revised AELA Bill was introduced into the State Legislature.

AEI announced a no-cost continuation of AELA Funding in July 2020.

This was after guidance for the programs to spend 100% of AELA Funds by July 31, 2020.

CAEPA Rendezvous Attendance: Annual conference attendance has been steadily declining for the last 3 years, potentially connected to a lack of State Leadership.

COVID-19 uncertainties: Planning for the annual conference would have started in November 2019 - but the above reasons pushed it to January 2020 - and then pandemic added new complexities to the decision making.
