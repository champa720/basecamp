Discovery

Kelly holds a Master’s degree in Adult Education and Training. She has been working in adult education for 13 years. Those 13 years of experience consist of work in contexts such as government, non-profit, and higher education settings. All of these contexts were in an administration role, not a teaching role. Following a move from Arizona to Colorado Kelly is currently working as the director of Grant Development and Compliance at the Community College of Denver. Her professional goal is to ensure adult education remains funded in Colorado, especially for at-risk and diverse populations. She is motivated by the belief that individuals deserve the opportunity to flourish into their best self and for all people to have equitable education opportunities. Kelly is currently working from home due to the Covid-19 Pandemic making personal connections more challenging.

Kelly has a general understanding of CAEPA as an organization that provides support to Adult Education in Colorado. She has a more comprehensive familiarity of the National Student Ambassador Programs from her previous work context in Arizona. Based on this previous experience, she is a supporter of Student Ambassador Programs because they help promote awareness of Adult Education within the community, provide powerful personal stories, and give students the opportunity to develop leadership and public speaking skills, especially when meeting with officials or other people in power. She also loves that Student Ambassador Programs give a personal face to the advocacy work that must be done frequently in adult education. Kelly is motivated to be proactive for the betterment of Colorado’s adult education programs.

Immersion

Kelly is someone who would organize, create, and facilitate a Student Ambassador group in her context at the Community College of Denver. In her previous role in Arizona, she received Student Ambassador training. This training included preparing Student Ambassador facilitators to organize student advocacy efforts for additional funding through the state legislature for adult education and to put students’ personal stories behind the need to fund this type of education. At a program level, she saw the advocacy efforts with the Student Ambassador Program result in added funding for adult education allowing for program expansion. With her experience working with Student Ambassadors, she saw participating students gain confidence, make connections, stay engaged in their program, and gain college and career readiness skills. She loves the Student Ambassador Program and is excited for them to become more prevalent in Colorado.

Connection

Kelly is currently not an active facilitator of a Student Ambassador Program due to the lack of their prevalence in Colorado. Although Kelly is passionate about the advocacy results of the Student Ambassador Program, she does not have the knowledge required to initiate a program. She does not know how to develop a curriculum that fosters the students’ advocacy skills. To close this gap, Kelly needs a designed curriculum to implement or training on high-impact practices that will empower students. She also does not have the knowledge of other adult educators in Colorado desiring to implement a Student Ambassador program. Kelly needs an in-person or on-line forum to connect and collaborate with other facilitators as a professional learning community.

Detachment

When considering Kelly’s desire to have increased advocacy for adult education, a need for a Colorado advocacy program. A pathway to this is explicit training on how to start and how to facilitate a Student Ambassador Program. Due to the nature of CAEPA providing aid for sites all around Colorado, this training will be best achieved through an online, module-based training. Module learning would include what the Student Ambassador Program is and its outcomes (supported by research), an example of an active and effective Student Ambassador Program, and a “starting-up” protocol. Open communication between the program facilitators and the CAEPA Student Ambassador Leaders will be required. Advantages of this solution include the remote availability of training, the ability to have actionable steps presented, and combination of personal-connection and technology-based training. A main disadvantage of this solution is the lack of student-student interaction available within the learning experience. A consequence of this solution could be that some resulting Student Ambassador Programs may be started, but not upkept and maintained.
