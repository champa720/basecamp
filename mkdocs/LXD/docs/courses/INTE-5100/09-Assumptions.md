Assumptions

In several instances, we contacted the primary stakeholder, CAEPA, to confirm logistics before moving forward and surveyed the field. However, we still made assumptions concerning some factors.

Organization level

The Ambassador Leaders program would be a training supporting only Adult Educators and did not provide support for Adult Learners.

CAEPA would be able to create course content based on the needs of Adult Educators.

CAEPA would be able to recruit influential leaders, industry experts, and adult education vendors to support module development and provide potential keynotes.

CAEPA would invite additional stakeholders into monthly board meetings for external feedback on the program.

CAEPA would fulfill moderation of forums and perform assessment interviews.

Learner level

The learner will be willing to participate in post-learning interviews

The learner will be able to implement new instructional strategies in their workspaces

Learners will be active participants in the collaboration process and visit forums consecutively and in a timely manner

If professional learning is available, adult educators will take advantage of the opportunity.

Learners will have a device and a reliable internet connection

Learners are willing to try new instructional strategies.
