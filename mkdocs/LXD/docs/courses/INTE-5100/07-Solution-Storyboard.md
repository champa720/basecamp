Solution Storyboard

The solution storyboard represents a learner’s experience through a microlearning course within the Ambassador Leaders program (Appendix 1). In the solution storyboard, we have provided an overview of the heart of the program and created a course containing four microlearning modules. Two of the four are detailed lessons, while the remaining two are present to demonstrate the progression of learning.
