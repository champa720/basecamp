Summary of Analysis

The learners we are targeting for this project are those who serve as adult educators. CAEPA describes those they serve as “adult education and family literacy programs from across Colorado that are diverse in nature: local community and faith-based organizations, community colleges, school districts, corrections facilities, workforce districts and libraries” (Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, n.d.). With so many diverse contexts being represented, the experience levels of adult educators greatly vary.

To assess problems and gaps across our wide spectrum of learners, we conducted several needs assessments, including, two-personal virtual interviews and a broad survey distributed to the adult education field at large. We also meet with stakeholders virtually, including, CAEPA Board of Directors and one of their affiliates, Literacy Coalition of Colorado — representatives present, from the Literacy Coalition, included District Libraries and volunteer teacher coordinator.

After conducting the multiple needs assessments, we analyzed each data group and the data as a whole. During the analysis, we discovered the entire field of Adult Education had similar problems and gaps; however, there was no singular emphasis of common need. We were able to organize these emerging patterns into six broad groups of problems and gaps (Appendix 1). When identifying possible solutions, we were able to filter these groups down to three interconnected needs to address (Proposed Learning Solution).

Virtual Interviews

We utilized methods found in Kouprie, M., & Visser, F. S. (2009). A framework for empathy in design, as a base for developing Learner Personas (Appendix 1, Appendix 1). These were created to aid in better understanding the needs of our learners. Both learning personas represent distinct stakeholders in the Ambassador Leaders program. These learner personas allowed us as instructional designers to discover our learners, immerse ourselves in their reality, connect to their reality, and detach to use our new knowledge for instruction development.

Summary of Learner Persona 1

Kelly is an example of a target learner in the formal adult education field. She has thirteen years of experience in adult education administration roles. Those thirteen years have been in various contexts such as government, non-profits, and higher education.

In a previous role in Arizona, Kelly had prior experiences with the national Student Ambassador program. She values how it promotes awareness of Adult Education within the community, gives a personal face to the work, and advocates for increased funding for Adult Education. Kelly desires programs like Student Ambassadors to become more prevalent in Colorado. She believes that more professional development and the creation of a learning community for facilitators.

Kelly’s perspective helped guide our decisions on the design plan. Her positive reactions to the National Student Ambassador program and desire to see it more prevalent in Colorado assured us that developing an Ambassador Leaders program would be well received. Kelly does not individually have the knowledge to create a curriculum to implement an advocacy program. This allows for our learning solution to include curriculum and professional learning to facilitate an advocacy program. She also does not have the knowledge of other adult educators in Colorado desiring to implement a Student Ambassador program. Kelly needs an in-person or online forum to connect and collaborate with other facilitators as a professional learning community.

Summary of Learner Persona 2

Nadine holds an Elementary education teaching license (K-6) and currently is employed with the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) where she has spent 5 years instructing adult education classes. Nadine’s prior experience includes 3 years of teaching adult education for non-profit organizations and has 2 years of experience in elementary education.

Nadine has a personal desire to learn to use modern web applications and to improve their instructional abilities through improved lesson design. As the CDOC is placing more emphasis on standards-based instruction, as well as career and technical education, these changes also become a learning opportunity for Nadine. She expressed this transition has added pressure and receives little support internally.

When designing the solution, we considered how we could support both of Nadine’s desires, professional learning in instructional skills, and a supportive professional community. We also considered Nadine’s limiting environment, CDOC, for a Student Ambassador program. With these considerations, the emphasis would need to be placed on professional learning that included professional support from their peers, with less focus on student ambassadors.

Adult Educator Survey

We also surveyed the field of adult educators in Colorado connected to CAEPA (Appendix 1). We inquired about the field’s workplace, familiarity with adult education associations, as well as their familiarity with Student Ambassador, and interest in participating. We also asked the field of their highest training needs personally and within their program. The following are major takeaways from the Adult Education Survey:

Background

The median experience level of respondents is 11.5 years with workplace contexts including community colleges, corrections, nonprofits, and other (publisher, self-employed, library services, community services).

Roughly two-thirds of respondents are adult education instructors. The remaining one-third identified as instructional trainers and program directors.

It’s evenly split by thirds, where respondents are currently working: in-person, hybrid, or remote/online. The majority are using online learning in some capacity.

Adult Education Associations

Respondents are more familiar with their State (CAEPA) and National (COABE) Association than their Regional (MPAEA) Association.

Student Ambassadors

Familiarity with the National Student Ambassador program is generally low. Almost half of the respondents are not interested in more information on the program. A quarter of respondents were unsure if they wanted more information.

This shows an overall negative response to the National Student Ambassador program. The overwhelmingly negative reaction towards the program led us to consider a name change for our program.

The following question asked about professional development needs for Student Ambassadors and the respondents’ reflect the previously seen interest level. However, the need for structure and support is consistently expressed.

Professional Learning

When asked about their personal professional learning needs, respondents’ expressed a desire for a large variety of professional development topics but the common theme surrounded effective remote learning. This will guide the content of microlearning experiences to have a focus on remote learning strategies. This will guide the content of microlearning experiences to have a focus on remote learning strategies.

When asked about professional learning for their program, respondents’ needs mirror the need for remote learning but added a clear need for learner community development. A portion of the microlearning experience will be collaborative in nature. It will connect adult educators and not only provide learning, but also a community.

Additional Stakeholders

Internal and external stakeholders had valuable input regarding the value of Ambassador Leaders to the learners and how the program could impact decision making at the Colorado Department of Education, Office of Adult Education.

After meeting with external stakeholders, the idea of tiered professional development came to mind. Their concern was with great diversity, comes diverse learning needs. This idea of tiered professional learning will benefit the programs in many ways. We see tiered training as a way to increase learner engagement by allowing learners to enter and build their skills over time, allowing for meaningful learning.

When designing the goal for the program, we wanted to instill a common thread for all professional learning. After meeting with the organization, we accepted their proposed change from “best practices” to “high impact practices”. This change places a degree of research and moves the training to student-centered.
