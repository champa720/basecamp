Instructional Objectives

Ambassador Leaders’ instructional objectives are at a high-level, measuring the effectiveness of each phase of the learners’ journey (Appendix 1). We encompassed the learning solution using the full range of Bloom’s taxonomy, following the hierarchical order forming the pyramid through each phase of the program. As the learner begins their journey, they will form the base of the pyramid and progressively move up the pyramid through the completion of each phase. Bloom’s Taxonomy

While designing each phase, we considered assessments and the instructional strategy to be used. As noted by Khalil, M. K., & Elkhider, I. A. (2016) there are three primary learning theories, behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructionism. We have identified the learning theory applied — informing instructional strategies to be applied — and the method to connect instruction and assessment, through each of the phases.

As we have proposed a robust learning solution, additional learning objectives will be provided during Phase 2 & 3. These objectives will be tied to the individual microlearning lessons within the online courses and will be developed as courses are created. We have developed a course to demonstrate this (Appendix 1).

Solution Design Goal

Through participation in Ambassador Leaders, Colorado adult educators will have reliably demonstrated the ability to use high impact practices and knowledge of advocacy strategies for the community, district, state, and national levels.

Phase 1: Prepare

These objectives are intended to be initially met through marketing materials and will take a behaviorist approach. Upon receipt of an announcement for professional learning, the new program will be outlined. When the learner engages and proceeds to register for the training, they will be asked retrieval based questions about new understandings about the Ambassador Leader program, as well as questions concerning types of professional learning they seek and details of their instructional contexts.

Objective 1.1

Remembering (Knowledge): The learner will define what Ambassador Leaders are.

Assessment: Multiple choice or short answer (retrieval based)

Objective 1.2

Understanding (Comprehension): The learner will explain how the Ambassador Leaders model is an extension of the national adult education Student Ambassador model.

Assessment: Compare and contrast short answer

Phase 2: Acquire Knowledge and Skills

These objectives will be met through the microlearning portion of the program’s professional development. Applying the cognitivist learning theory, new information will be explained, demonstrated, or illustrated with the intent that the learner is actively participating in the instruction. Content leveling, or tiers, will further support the acquisition of new knowledge and is framed by the cognitivist learning theory (Ertmer, P. A., & Newby, T. J., 2013). Assessments will be conducted within the microlearning courses, aligning to each course’s sub-objectives, and participant tracking will assess the program objective.

Objective 2.1

Applying (Application): The learner will contribute to Ambassador Leaders through forums, training, and advocacy efforts.

Assessment: Track learner engagement

Objective 2.1.1

Microlearning course objectives

Assessment will be embedded in the microlearning course

Phase 3: Build Memory and Apply on the Job

These objectives will be met through the collaborative exploration and application of the program’s microlearning courses. Applying the theory of constructivism, “Learners do not transfer knowledge from the external world into their memories; rather they build personal interpretations of the world based on individual experiences and interactions” (Ertmer, P. A., & Newby, T. J., 2013). This phase will encourage learners to incorporate new strategies in their practices while building a supportive professional community. Assessments for objective 3.1 and 3.2 will include reflections. Reflecting first, during peer collaboration, on their experience in Ambassador Leaders and their professional learning. Then again, learners will reflect on what has changed in their practices based on their experience in Ambassador Leaders.

Objective 3.1

Analyzing (Analysis): The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado’s adult education programs, educators, and students.

Assessment: Formative reflection surveys and feedback opportunities

Objective 3.2

Evaluating (Evaluation): The learner will select appropriate high impact practices that promote student’s skill-building, self-awareness, agency, and self-efficacy.

Assessment: Summative reflection survey on practices before and after training.

Phase 4: Maintain Use Over Time

This objective will be met through the learners’ long-term application of their professional learning. Continuing with the constructivist theory, learning is “facilitated by involvement in authentic tasks anchored in meaningful contexts” (Ertmer, P. A., & Newby, T. J., 2013). A form of communication outreach will facilitate the assessment of this objective. It is intended to record successes in the field of Adult Education through various forms of media and publicly available — raising awareness and advocating.

Objective 4.1

Creating (Synthesis): The learner will build safe and inclusive learning environments utilizing skills gained through Ambassador Leaders.

Assessment: Document successes through media; i.e. interviews, program spotlights, student and educator interviews.
