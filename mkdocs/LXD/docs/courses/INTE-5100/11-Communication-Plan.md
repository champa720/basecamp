Communication Plan

Communication will be open between CAEPA and the instructional designers. With milestone encapsulating deliverables and tasks, we, the designers, will be able to provide quick assistance, if needed, based on simple questions. Scheduled communication with CAEPA will take place on the third Monday of every month at the scheduled CAEPA board meeting through video conference. With project milestones set and a project timeline in place for a Beta Release, these will provide means of project tracking and guide our communication plan. Examples of such communication might include:

How is the Pre-Release milestone coming along?

Are you on track to meet the completion date?
