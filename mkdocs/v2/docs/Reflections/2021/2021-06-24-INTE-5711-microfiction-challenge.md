## 100-word microfiction (Original)

At the top of the hill stood a mighty oak tree; its leaves blowing gently in the wind on a bright sunny day. The oak, both flowers and seeds when other oaks are desired in fall before resting through the winter.  The seeds (acorns) are tough with a soft inside - holding onto great potential, strength, and agility. Acorns fall from the oak and roll down the hill. No longer in the comforting environment; finding themselves an uncertain world. Nature supports the acorns with elements, wind, water, fire, earth. Animals play and help move them to a place to grow - thrive.

As I cut out more words, I notice I quickly lose the story, however I began distilling the words down to the central meaning or a main point / theme of the original 100-word microfiction.
