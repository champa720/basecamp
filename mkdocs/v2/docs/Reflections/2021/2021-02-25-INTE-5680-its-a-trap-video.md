**Name 2 elements from each video that you liked.**

1. Covered the topics of the tutorial upfront, noting the price of the software
2. Spent quality time explaining the purpose of scripting and their scripting process

**Name 2 elements from each video that you disliked.**

1. This was software specific for both audio recording and animation. For 5 minutes of the video they demonstrated the software.
2. This felt more like a software demo than a tutorial. If I were to be using the software demonstrated, this tutorial would give me a great overview of what is possible.
