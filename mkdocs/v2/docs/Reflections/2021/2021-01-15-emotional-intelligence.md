I follow inc., an online business publication. The other morning ran across this headline, [Spotify's CEO Just Boiled Down Everything You Need to Know About Emotional Intelligence Into Only 8 Words](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/spotify-daniel-ek-tim-ferriss-emotional-intelligence.html). I was intrigued! How can a person distill the complexities of emotional intelligence down to just eight words? If you are too, take a look at their article to see their breakdown. It's worth the quick read.

Below I am sharing the full interview with Daniel Ek, Spotify's CEO. I was surprised at how humble a CEO can be.
