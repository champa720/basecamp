Have you every heard to the 1-9-90 social media statistic? My new years resolution includes moving out of the 90% (content consumers) into the 9% (content contributors) and strive towards becoming in the 1% (original content creators). I have set out do do this within my LinkedIn network, posting interesting and relevant news stories relating to learning and teaching. My latest story happens to be from YouTube - but is also available on TedTalks. I posted the video to raise awareness or to question #unconciousbias within language.

Headline: Anna Babel wanders through many topics concerning language, including the role of unconscious bias in listening, speaking, and understanding language.
