At the beginning of the course, I was talking to a friend about LXD/ID. I was trying to describe how we put learners at the center and design the best experience for them. However, at the time, the DOJ had just made a ruling, August 13, 2020: [Justice Department Finds Yale Illegally Discriminates Against Asians and Whites in Undergraduate Admissions in Violation of Federal Civil-Rights Laws](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-yale-illegally-discriminates-against-asians-and-whites-undergraduate). The gist of the story, Yale admissions had a staggered SAT acceptance score for each race/ethnicity. They too were trying to accommodate the needs of their potential learners. My friend had a hard time grasping how we could hold high standards and be accountable while also designing to the learners' needs. Assessment plays into their misunderstanding as well as rigor.
