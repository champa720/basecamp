To be honest, I have lumped Universal Design, Universal Design for Learning, and Inclusive Design together in past professional learning that I have presented. They are similar, in that they all attempt to create learning environments that are accessible to all.

I think some of the confusion comes from their histories, and evolution over time. From my understanding, [Universal design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) started out in architecture and [Inclusive Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusive_design) was brought about from the digital age.

I’ve even come across articles that point to differences in methods of design. [Oregon State University](http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspire/2019/12/16/accessibility-universal-design-for-learning-udl-and-inclusive-design-what-do-they-really-mean/) describes that Universal Design for Learning starts from the outset of course creation - like architecture - thinking through the [UDL Guidelines](http://udlguidelines.cast.org/). Whereas, Inclusive design encapsulates UDL and adds an iterative layer - going back to Brad’s statement, “you don’t know what you don’t know.” After users’ have experienced the course, their feedback is incorporated in the evaluation phase for the next iteration - is this Inclusive Design?

Oregon State had a graphic depicting a hierarchy, with Universal Design for Learning wrapped by Inclusive Design. I have also seen it flipped. So are they the same? Like I said at the start I have lumped them together in the past, but I am genuinely curious.

I’ve watched many presentations by Laura Kalbog, who emphasizes accessibility, use [universal design](https://2017.ind.ie/archive/summit/videos/laura-kalbag/) to step to inclusive design. Laura typically speaks at [Web Developer's conferences](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=vid&q=laura+kalbag), and recently released a short video, [Accessibility in 2020](https://laurakalbag.com/accessibility-in-2020/), which addresses all three and then adds privacy and equity issues to the list. Maybe Laura is advocating for higher standards in the profession, see [Disruptive Designs](https://youtu.be/qofn4NcIF8E?t=459).

Could it be that the definitions alter depending on the profession or part of the world you live in? Is it the keyword inclusion that blurs the lines?

I think the "how we UDL" would be a valuable addition to the Learning Design and Technology course selection, as well as, the "why we UDL".

Update: Has anyone heard of [Ethical Design](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design), is this a thing?
