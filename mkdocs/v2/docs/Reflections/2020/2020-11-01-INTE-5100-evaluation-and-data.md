title: Evaluation and data
---

??? quote "Assignment"
    As data becomes increasingly ubiquitous and at our fingertips, the intelligent evaluation of our solution designs become more and more critical.

    What might be an inappropriate or unethical method of evaluation given the broad spectrum of data we now potentially have access to? In answering this question, you can refer to your own solution design project, or speak about methods of evaluation generally.

At the beginning of the course, I was talking to a friend about LXD/ID. I was trying to describe how we put learners at the center and design the best experience for them. However, at the time, the DOJ had just made a ruling, August 13, 2020: [Justice Department Finds Yale Illegally Discriminates Against Asians and Whites in Undergraduate Admissions in Violation of Federal Civil-Rights Laws](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-finds-yale-illegally-discriminates-against-asians-and-whites-undergraduate). The gist of the story, Yale admissions had a staggered SAT acceptance score for each race/ethnicity. They too were trying to accommodate the needs of their potential learners. My friend had a hard time grasping how we could hold high standards and be accountable while also designing to the learners' needs. Assessment plays into their misunderstanding as well as rigor.
