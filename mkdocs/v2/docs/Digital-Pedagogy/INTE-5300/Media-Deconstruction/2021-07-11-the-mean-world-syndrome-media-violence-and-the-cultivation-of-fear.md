??? quote "Assignment"
    Like last week, you will use the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy to deconstruct the ads and clips below. In addition to the 5 Key questions, I have developed a Media Artifact Interrogation and Analysis Framework to assist teachers and students expand their analysis of critical media literacy to include how media messages address global/historical focus, race, culture, violence, power, and happiness. These questions are designed to supplement the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy to inspire sociopolitical development and action.

    As you are looking at the examples in this Media Deconstruction Exercise use the five key questions and consider the media artifact in terms of these supplemental questions. You do not have to answer all of the questions for each artifact - just the ones that stand out to you like the most pertinent.

[Hamilton | Official Trailer | Disney+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSCKfXpAGHc)

1. **Who created this message?**

    I would imagine the Disney+ marketing team created the message.

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    Typical Disney intro, and movie theatrics, heavy base, and leading soundtrack. Large titles bring excitement to the live action of the trailer.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

    I mean, I'm confused by it. Is it a recording of the Broadway show or a recreation? But those familiar and those who are fans of "Hamilton" will meet it with anticipation.

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    I'm not sure, this Broadway show received a lot of press about being a hip-hop historical adventure? Are we critiquing the Broadway show, Disney interpretation of that (are they the same), or the movie trailer?

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    This message is advertising for a movie showing on Disney+. It is intended to inform or recruit subscribers to the service.

[Hop "In Common"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX-9yVAR2dc)

1. **Who created this message?**

    From the YouTube page, "The film is helmed by Tim Hill, director of the blockbuster Alvin and the Chipmunks and produced by Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me)." So I would imagine the film studio put it together for marketing the film to families - as it looks to be a family film.

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    I would consider this a typical movie trailer, with the film studio upfront and that deep-voiced narration of the movie. The studio pulled out select sense and collaged them together to make the movie seem lighthearted and funny.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    This movie trailer is targeting families looking for a day out on a holiday - it reaches kids most. Those excluded would be those how don't celebrate this holiday. From what I gather removes the religious overtones too. It's aimed at dominant white America, as there is a lack of people of color and or characters of color in the trailer.

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    This message is targetting Kids as seen by the "Try YouTube Kids" link on the YouTube page. Since it is listed on YouTube Kids, it will more likely be seen by younger YouTube viewers. They will then ask their parents to see the movie.

6. **Whose history is portrayed in this message?**

    Anyone how celebrates Easter via the Easter Bunny.

7. **Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value?**

    Yes, this is a movie trailer intended to pull in a larger viewing audience.

8. **What is the story that this advertisement/message tells us about how we should behave?**

    Looking at the trailer, it appears the main character is trying to help the animated characters fulfill some sort of goal.

[Toys R Us "Making Wishes Come True"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfnuFrE5_M0)

1. **Who created this message?**

    The YouTube page states, "Toys R Us made the wishes of kids come true by taking them to Toys R Us and giving them anything they wanted. Making their dreams come true just in time for the holidays. Watch some of our kids as they express true joy." So this was put together to drive positive attention to the brand. Is Toys R Us still around?

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    An upbeat jungle and a field trip pull the viewer along the Toys R Us adventure.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

    I would want o know how I can get on the free toy list, is this just a publicity stunt or does Toys R Us donate toys to shelters? I think parents will see it as a publicity stunt, or if they are in poverty, feel emotional guilt for not being able to provide extravagant gifts.

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    These kids all look from middle-class families or at least they visited the wardrobe department before filming the commercial. It's also not filmed in an urban setting, suggesting suburbs.

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    Same as the previous video, this one also targets kids and is hosted on YouTube kids. I'm not sure why it is hosted by "Tannen's Talent" perhaps it is to recruit child actors?

6. **Are youth portrayed as powerful or weak in this message?**

    Youth are portrayed as innocent, low-income parents might feel judged.

7. **Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value?**

    Yes, this advertisement is trying to sell the idea of a positive brand.

8. **Is there a link between this commodity/message and happiness?**

    Kids are happy to be receiving gifts of their choosing. Demonstrating material things bring comfort.
