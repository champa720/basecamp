## Reflection

1. **Reflect upon the personal care and beauty products you use on a regular basis. What makes the advertisement for these items stay in your memory? Do you think advertising influences the kinds of products you buy? If yes, how? If no, explain why you think you’re able to resist it.**

    I am not a brand loyalist and find new products primarily on the shelves at marketplaces that I support. Some marketplaces vet the products before selling, checking product ingredients, environmental impacts, labor, and other ethical concerns. I gain insight into some products through product reviews - that I search out - and others through product recommendations. I approach both of these with an eye of skepticism, especially user reviews.

    Mostly I find new products without advertisements and will trial products because they are there. If I like the product, I will continue buying it. One example would be [Chandrika Ayurvedic Soap](https://www.auromere.com/products/chandrika-ayurvedic-soap/http://www.chandrikasoaps.com/chandrika-ayurvedic-soap.html). I picked up the soap originally because it was the cheapest at $1.00 and natural.

    I do not resist advertisements, I just am not exposed to or heavily influenced by advertisements. My only mode of consuming media is online or print. While online, I use a VPN and a Browser-based content blocker. Together, these eliminate all advertising from sight, even on advertising-based services, i.e. Google, YouTube, etc.

2. **What are some common stereotypes about feminists and feminism? Where do you think these stereotypes come from? What terms are often used for those who voice strong opinions? How might these terms serve to keep people from voicing their opinions?**

    For starters, who's common stereotypes are we considering; are we looking at the dominant White culture feminists, Latinx feminists, Black Trans feminists, female nonfeminists, or dominant media portrayal of feminism? Stereotypes will vary amongst different groups of people, time periods, and are an illogical fallacy - a misinformed social construct. The only way to answer this question is from my point of view; otherwise, I would be making a false assumption of another's viewpoint on feminism and feminists.

    Stereotypes emerge from systems of power and those seeking to maintain power, privilege, and social location. They may arise within any group. Those being oppressed may also develop stereotypes of their oppressors. Stereotypes emerge as broad generalizations based solely on perceived differences or perceived behaviors.

    Some terms used to describe those who voice strong opinions: Bitch, Dick, Leadership, Bossy, Creative, Defiant, Pushy, Obstinant, Threatening, Intimidating, Decisive, Intense, and many more... Term usage may change among groups and may be applied differently within specific communities, gender identities, sexual orientations, race, ethnicities, etc...

    All the above comes down to holding on to power.

3. **Consider and describe other social movements where people were labeled in ways that deflected attention away from the actual issues being addressed.**

    !!! quote "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)"

        COINTELPRO (syllabic abbreviation derived from Counter Intelligence Program) (1956–1971) was a series of covert and illegal projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic American political machines.

    Some groups targeted by the government operation included:

    - Feminist Movement
    - Anti-Vietnam War
    - Civil Rights Movement
    - Black Power Movement
    - American Indian Movement
    - Environmental and Animal Rights groups

    The project was carried out through numerous tactics including perjury, witness tampering & intimidation, withholding of evidence, and more. The aim of the operation was to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise, neutralize" activities carried out by the organizations (n.d., [COINTELPRO Revisited](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/COINTELPRO/COINTELPRO-FBI.docs.html)). Methods used to fulfill the aim included: Infiltration, Psychological warfare, Harassment via the legal system, Illegal force, and undermining public opinion (n.d., [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)).

    The tactics aims and methods used by COINTELPRO are still alive and well, and have defined a playbook to disrupt current political movements and activism. One such group under disruption would be Black Lives Matter. Known FBI assessments of the organization are built and based upon anti-Black racial stereotypes (2019, [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/race-and-criminal-justice/fbi-wont-hand-over-its-surveillance-records-black)). In today's media landscape, misinformation runs rampant and serves only one purpose, to undermine public opinion (2021, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/25/999841030/black-lives-matter-fights-disinformation-to-keep-the-movement-strong)).

4. **What are some typical expectations of femininity in our culture? Where do these expectations come from? How fair or accurate do you think they are? And how do they compare with our expectations of masculinity?**

    Feminity differs culturally and worldwide. In the U.S. femininity can relate to numerous gender identities and sexual orientations. Masculinity typically falls on straight males. The U.S. is a multicultural nation.

    Some generalized expressions of femininity and masculinity in the U.S. media may include, but are not limited to:

    |Feminine                         |Masculine                        |
    |:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
    |Hairlessness                     |Hairy                            |
    |Agreeable                        |Stubborn                         |
    |Princess (needs rescuing)        |Hero (rescuer)                   |
    |Helpless                         |Independent                      |
    |Requires specific fashion        |Requires specific fashion        |
    |Expected to primmed and ready    |Acceptable to be disheveled      |
    |Kind                             |Benevolent                       |
    |Weak                             |Strong                           |
    |Compassionate                    |Aggressive                       |
    |Endure hardships                 |Overcome hardships               |
    |Soft                             |Hard                             |
    |Pliable                          |Controlling                      |
    |Peaceful                         |Concurring                       |
    |Gentle                           |Forceful                         |
    |Relatable                        |Dominating                       |
    |stepping back                    |Taking charge                    |

    The binary of femininity and masculinity are rooted in systems of oppression used to divide and miscategorize humans - those with and without power. They place impossible expectations at both ends of the spectrum, which no gender can meet. Noting here that there are more ways to express one's identity, take androgeny for example.

    These dominant gender expression expectations can cause a disconnect with self, creating deep personal trauma, that may inhibit meaningful relationships with others. This disconnect can lead to dysfunctional behaviors. Ultimately, this binary of gender expression prevents a full expression of one's identity and divides oneself as much as they disconnect ourselves from others. It denies people from living to their full humanness.

    These expressions are cultivated within societal norms, can be culturally diverse, and are passed down within communities and families. These expectations are instilled into children at young ages to repeat the cycle.

    Some U.S. expectations of feminity include: hairlessness, agreeable, princess (needs rescuing), helplessness, requires specific fashion (expected to always look ready for ?), kind, weak, compassionate, endure, soft, pliable, peaceful, gentle, relatable, stepping back.

    Masculinity typically falls on straight males in the U.S. Expectations of masculinity concurring, dominating, controlling, hairy, strong, taking charge,
