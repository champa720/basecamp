    QUEST: You are the detective and the prosecutor.  Explore my backstory, find the clues and prepare your case to prosecute the catfish...

    Your prosecution should be like that of a trial lawyer.  Have your proof in order and present your case to the jury (the class).  You must make your case in the format of a digital-story.  You must convince us beyond a reasonable doubt that _______ is in fact, the catfish.

## Backstory

Why yes, I believe I solved this case HG Wells, Author, Inventor, Futurist, Socialist. Using a variety of background information I found in Circle and some further digital tools, I think I have found PROOF of the imposter! I created a slideshow and narrated my process and deductions. I need to work on my prosecutorial narrative.

## Process

I began by clicking through the Circle site following all the #Catfish and looking into the posts, comments, spaces of the suspect's list. Iâ€™ve also been observant of anything in Hypothesis. After putting together some additional leads I began putting together a collection of screen recordings, but then swung back to just screen captures - thinking about time. At this point, I decided to assemble a slide show, and walk through the evidence.

In my imagination, this would have taken place in a courtroom, and I would be addressing a jury OR perhaps in a detective format.

## Time & Stretch

It took me 4-6 hours to click through all the evidence and assemble it into a slideshow and record a prosecutorial narrative. This was a one-shot video using Loom Screen and Video recorder, it was my first time using this tool in this manner. To stretch further, I would move this into a video editor (Premiere Pro) and see if I could bring my imagination to life.
