??? quote "Assignment"
    Last week you read an article on audience archetypes and identified your own archetype. For your first mini-thing, tell us what what your archetype is, and share a piece of media (image, gif, song, video, etc) that captures the character of your audience archetype in a post on the #Mini-things channel. Why did you choose this piece of media? How does it reflect your audience archetype?

## Backstory

Well, while I was "seeking" out media I traveled all over the place finding connections and relations that may connote meaning of this archetype... I landed on three pieces.

1.  This represents my brain... engaged and synapsis firing, making connections from the different hemispheres to the different sections of the brain. While in a good story, my mind wanders and connects, emotions, sounds, images, while curiosity drives the connections further.
2.  This is my "rabbit hole" so many seekers have described... It isn't driven by any singular point but explodes. One point of curiosity becomes many points and so on.
3.  I think this describes the layering of ideas, the many pieces adding to the whole, continually moving deeper into the story. When one story leaves off the next picks up.

All of these add up to seeking... finding meanings, the interconnectedness, the layering, and the continuation of a story. When a story grabs me, I am fully engrossed - no secondary devices or alternate activities. However, after a good story - I will be searching out additional information - to go deeper into the story, characters, and any connections that it stimulated in my mind. Creative expression sometimes follows...
