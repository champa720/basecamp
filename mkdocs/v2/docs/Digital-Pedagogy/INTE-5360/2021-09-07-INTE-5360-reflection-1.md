# Reflection 1

!!! quote "Pippi Longstocking (pp. 40-41)"

    "Yes, but just think how embarrassing it will be for you to be so ignorant. Imagine when you grow up and somebody asks you what the capital of Portugal is and you can't answer!"

    "Oh, I can answer all right," said Pippi. "I'll answer like this" 'If you are so bound and determined to find out what the capital of Portugal is, the for goodness' sakes, write directly to Portugal and ask.'"

    "Yes, but don't you think that you would be sorry not to know it yourself?"

    "Oh, probably," said Pippi. "No doubt I should lie awake nights and wonder, ' What in the world is the capital of Portugal?' But one can't be having fun all the time," she continued, bending over and standing on her hands for a change. "For that matter, I've been to Lisbon with my papa," she added, still standing upside down, for she could talk that way too.

I selected the quote above, as an example of the "banking model" of education. It has long persisted, but not without criticism, IMHO. The example is dated, in thinking how we have technology at our fingertips to assist in recalling such information - the capital of Portugal - but exemplifies the rote nature of education at the time and currently. I suppose it would be useful in trivia environments...

In thinking about how Lindgren frames the teacher/student relationship it shows a deep discontent, as Pippi challenges the teacher (system) through out the series. But thats why I really enjoy Pippi Longstocking... because Pippi never fails to challenge social norms, is always learning,  building community, and problem-posing questions in discussion.
