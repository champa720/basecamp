??? quote "Assignment"
    The inspiration for this celebratory activity is from one of [Stefan Sagmeister's early TED Talks](https://youtu.be/eZp-H9g_jeY) on Happiness by Design, in which he first mentions his list of life lessons learned.

    Please create a creative design lesson learned from the course and post it here. You can represent your lesson learned via a drawing, comic strip. photo display, presentation slide, podcast/audio clip, TikTok video, music video, macaroni artwork. or interpretive dance -- wherever your creative spirit takes you! :-)
