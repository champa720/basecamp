??? quote "Assignment"
    We're so happy to have you in this course (no, seriously). We're big believers in the power of community, so in order to learn together, we need to better understand each other. Let's engage in some brief introductions. Feel free to use video/audio. instead of a text-based response. In your response, please share (at least) the following information:

      - Your preferred name / pronouns
      - A unique or fun fact about you
      - What interests you and/or makes you smile/laugh
      - Your experience (if any) with LXD/ID
      - Your progress/experience in the UCD LDT program
