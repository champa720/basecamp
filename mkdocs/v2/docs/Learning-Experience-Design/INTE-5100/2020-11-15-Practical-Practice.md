??? quote "Assignment"
    You've finished grad school and have been asked to interview for an instructional design position with an innovative organization. You step into the interview and the first question they ask is:

    > How do your instructional design skills set you apart from the other instructional designers that we're interviewing?

    Their follow-up question is:

    > Where do you still need to develop as an instructional designer?

    As you develop your response to both questions, consider what specific skills you've learned during this course. Did you learn anything about yourself that was previously unknown or undiscovered?
