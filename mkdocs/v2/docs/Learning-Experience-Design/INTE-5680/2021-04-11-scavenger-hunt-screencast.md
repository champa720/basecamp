## Learning/Experience

Screen recording is a challenge. I filmed the screen recording multiple times, working to have the timings balanced between each section. I slowly removed content from the recordings and even removed a section in the editing process.

I was able to edit the audio from Premiere into Audition without issue. In Audition, I ran both narration and soundtrack through a loudness match and saved it. In Premiere, I used keyframes on the soundtrack to limit the volume, as it slowly gains throughout the track.

I used the razor tool to split the continuous screencast into sections to apply transitions. For this project, I doubled up on the transition effects, incorporating a fade to black under a sweeping effect. I've been playing with transitions a bit in other projects. I think it works here.

## Tools

- Webcam - Logitech C922 Pro Stream
- Loom
- Adobe Premiere Pro
- Adobe Audition

## Successes

I'm putting all my video editing skills together. This production flowed together. I set up the sequence using HD settings for the text to be as crisp as possible. I was pleased to see all the content naturally fit into the safe zone guides. All the little pieces, such as adding titles, captions, credits, and transitions, are becoming nonissues. I also think the narration and soundtrack don't compete but complement each other.

## Struggles

I kept forgetting to turn off my space heater before recording. But really, no struggles to highlight in this project. Hurray!
