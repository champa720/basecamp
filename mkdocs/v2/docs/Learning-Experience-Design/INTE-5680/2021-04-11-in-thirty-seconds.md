## Learning/Experience

In this simple project, I gained insight into sequence settings. When I typically start a video project, the source video sets the sequence settings. For this project, I had no source video as it is using only graphics frames. I learned that Adobe Premiere's sequence settings impact the text rendered.

I spent some time adjusting the timings of each text section. I was trying to find the balance between readability and timing. The project includes a test that naturally has a time range of 1-2 seconds for each frame digitally. A hard copy timing would allow the user to determine the timings.

I had to make many decisions throughout the project, mainly on text size and duration. I also include cross-dissolves in an early iteration but decided they harmed the overall project, in this case.

## Tools

- Adobe Premiere Pro

## Successes

I created a shortened version of the Stroop Effect test. It provides instructions and follow-up search terms at the end. All completed within thirty seconds. Success!

## Struggles

The only struggle I ran into was the sequence settings in this project. Blurry text isn't good for anyone. I find it odd that even though my original settings were correct, they produced an unexpected output. The internet showed me that I'm not the only one confused by this. It has something to do with Adobe and high-definition.
