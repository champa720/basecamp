As Mexican Americans, they were placed in three years of first grade as a way to discriminate against them by the all White school board, administration and faculty. Stolen Education documents the journey to recapture the remarkable story of the schoolchildren who changed educational history in Texas and to confront the continued inequity in public schools today.

    In 1998, university professor Kembrew McLeod (Associate Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Iowa) trademarked the phrase "freedom of expression" - a startling comment on the way that intellectual property law restricts creativity and expression of ideas. This provocative and amusing documentary explores the battles being waged in courts, classrooms, museums, film studios, and the Internet over control of our cultural commons. Based on McLeod's award-winning book of the same title, Freedom of Expression charts the many successful attempts to push back this assault by overzealous copyright holders. Freedom of Expression is an essential tool for educators, activists, filmmakers, students, artists, librarians, and more.
