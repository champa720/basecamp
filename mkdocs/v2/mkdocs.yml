    I am a person who is passionate about education. I enjoy inspiring people around me and taking in the knowledge that they have to share. Life isnâ€™t always easy and we all have struggles, some more than others, but with a little understanding we can help each other overcome and succeed.

    This perhaps is why I enjoy working in education.
