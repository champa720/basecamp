## Learning/Experience

I set out to recreate a "circle" scene from the popular TV Series, "That 70s Show" (1998-2006). I thought it would be a creative way to present a reflection of 5680 Producing Media. I kept the dialogue short and focused on the transitions between the "characters." I initially set up some background images to test my production transition idea. It worked! But became much more complicated when adding in the video.

## Tools

- Quicktime
- Webcam - Logitech C922 Pro Stream
- Adobe Premiere Pro
- Adobe Audition

## Successes

I spent extra time setting up lighting and a "green screen" to use a difference mask keyframe. I've been experimenting with the effect a lot and its results are becoming better. The most challenging part is consistent lighting. My environment doesn't provide very consistent lighting because of power fluctuations - is my guess. The result was pretty good. Some bulleted success:

- The dialogue is clear but very sparse.
- The transitions came out nicely.
- The audio is leveled.

As a final bonus, I cut out some laugh tracks from an episode and embedded them under the dialogue. I think the volume balance is good, and it adds another element to the recreation. To achieve this, I ran Adobe Audition through Premiere Pro to level the loudness and edit the audio.

## Struggles

All the successes listed were struggles. However, they were struggles that I think I overcame. In my initial thinking, I thought background changes would give each "character" enough distinction. I am not sure it does. I also considered Using some additional images, sunglasses, mustache, or something to place on each character to make them more different.
