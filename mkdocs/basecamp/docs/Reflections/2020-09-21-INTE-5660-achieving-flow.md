5-Factors of the flow state:

1.  Intrinsically rewarding
2.  Clear goals and a sense of progress
3.  Clear and immediate feedback
4.  Match of challenge and skill - agency
5.  Intense focus on present moment

Learner support for flow state:

-   Tap into intrinsic motivation: task they want to do vs have to do
-   Embrace student choice (agency): allow them to own their learning
-   Provide scaffolding: so student can choice the correct amount of challenge and skill (perceived ability)
-   Minimize distractions: change pacing + more time
-   Help students monitor their progress: set goals, analyze tasks, figure what to do, make adjustments, reflect on progress
