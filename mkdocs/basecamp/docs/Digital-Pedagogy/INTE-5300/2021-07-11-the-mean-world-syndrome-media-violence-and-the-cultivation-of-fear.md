## Media Deconstruction

Like last week, you will use the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy to deconstruct the ads and clips below. In addition to the 5 Key questions, I have developed a Media Artifact Interrogation and Analysis Framework to assist teachers and students expand their analysis of critical media literacy to include how media messages address global/historical focus, race, culture, violence, power, and happiness. These questions are designed to supplement the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy to inspire sociopolitical development and action.

As you are looking at the examples in this Media Deconstruction Exercise use the five key questions and consider the media artifact in terms of these supplemental questions. You do not have to answer all of the questions for each artifact - just the ones that stand out to you like the most pertinent.

### Hamilton | Official Trailer | Disney+

<div class="aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16-9">
  <iframe class="aspect-ratio--content" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DSCKfXpAGHc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

1. **Who created this message?**

    I would imagine the Disney+ marketing team created the message.

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    Typical Disney intro, and movie theatrics, heavy base, and leading soundtrack. Large titles bring excitement to the live action of the trailer.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

    I mean, I'm confused by it. Is it a recording of the Broadway show or a recreation? But those familiar and those who are fans of "Hamilton" will meet it with anticipation.

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    I'm not sure, this Broadway show received a lot of press about being a hip-hop historical adventure? Are we critiquing the Broadway show, Disney interpretation of that (are they the same), or the movie trailer?

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    This message is advertising for a movie showing on Disney+. It is intended to inform or recruit subscribers to the service.

### Hop - TV Spot: "In Common"

<div class="aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16-9">
  <iframe class="aspect-ratio--content" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kX-9yVAR2dc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

1. **Who created this message?**

    From the YouTube page, "The film is helmed by Tim Hill, director of the blockbuster Alvin and the Chipmunks and produced by Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me)." So I would imagine the film studio put it together for marketing the film to families - as it looks to be a family film.

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    I would consider this a typical movie trailer, with the film studio upfront and that deep-voiced narration of the movie. The studio pulled out select sense and collaged them together to make the movie seem lighthearted and funny.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    This movie trailer is targeting families looking for a day out on a holiday - it reaches kids most. Those excluded would be those how don't celebrate this holiday. From what I gather removes the religious overtones too. It's aimed at dominant white America, as there is a lack of people of color and or characters of color in the trailer.

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    This message is targetting Kids as seen by the "Try YouTube Kids" link on the YouTube page. Since it is listed on YouTube Kids, it will more likely be seen by younger YouTube viewers. They will then ask their parents to see the movie.

6. **Whose history is portrayed in this message?**

    Anyone how celebrates Easter via the Easter Bunny.

7. **Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value?**

    Yes, this is a movie trailer intended to pull in a larger viewing audience.

8. **What is the story that this advertisement/message tells us about how we should behave?**

    Looking at the trailer, it appears the main character is trying to help the animated characters fulfill some sort of goal.


### Toys R Us "Making Wishes Come True" Bus Full of Kids Commercial

<div class="aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16-9">
  <iframe class="aspect-ratio--content" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HfnuFrE5_M0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

1. **Who created this message?**

    The YouTube page states, "Toys R Us made the wishes of kids come true by taking them to Toys R Us and giving them anything they wanted. Making their dreams come true just in time for the holidays. Watch some of our kids as they express true joy." So this was put together to drive positive attention to the brand. Is Toys R Us still around?

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    An upbeat jungle and a field trip pull the viewer along the Toys R Us adventure.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

    I would want o know how I can get on the free toy list, is this just a publicity stunt or does Toys R Us donate toys to shelters? I think parents will see it as a publicity stunt, or if they are in poverty, feel emotional guilt for not being able to provide extravagant gifts.

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    These kids all look from middle-class families or at least they visited the wardrobe department before filming the commercial. It's also not filmed in an urban setting, suggesting suburbs.

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    Same as the previous video, this one also targets kids and is hosted on YouTube kids. I'm not sure why it is hosted by "Tannen's Talent" perhaps it is to recruit child actors?

6. **Are youth portrayed as powerful or weak in this message?**

    Youth are portrayed as innocent, low-income parents might feel judged.

7. **Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value?**

    Yes, this advertisement is trying to sell the idea of a positive brand.

8. **Is there a link between this commodity/message and happiness?**

    Kids are happy to be receiving gifts of their choosing. Demonstrating material things bring comfort.

## Media Use Journal

1. **Has your choice for news or journalistic information changed over time? In what ways?**

    Gowing up, the 5 o'clock network news was on when my father was home. I did not pay attention to what was being reported. I was disconnected from journalistic information through Middle School, High School, and even into my early adult years. It wasn't until a few years into college that I started paying attention to journalistic information; this would put me in my early twenties. I began my studies as a Fine Arts student, therefore my interest surrounded Art periodicals. I then branched into Anthropology, Political Science, and Sociology. Of course, this opened a wider array of journalistic media. I discovered NPR, and would listen to News Entertainment shows on the weekend, and then started tuning in to the weekday morning news cycles to better understand News Entertainment. As I continued in college, my journalistic information consumption continued to expand. As journalistic information slowly evolved and became widely distributed on the internet, my attention turned to online media. News aggregate feeds became reliable, and today I use Feedly & Google News aggregators. Both services allow unlimited sources to be combined into one news feed. I use each service differently, Feedly for personal interests and Google News for current events (World, Local).

2. **Is there a news story from your childhood that stands out to you as being particularly memorable? Did your perception of the world around you shift following your experience? In what ways? Note: Mainstream News programming can be particularly triggering for some. If memory is too traumatic to recount, please feel free to skip this question or consider reframing the question in a way that works for you.**

    As mentioned in question one, I did not pay attention to the news networks growing up.

3. **Do you now actively seek out journalistic sources for information? If yes, what are those sources? What platforms do you use to access that information? Do you access different platforms for different types of news (i.e.; political, financial, sports, entertainment)?**

    Currently, I do not seek out journalistic sources. The 2020 news cycle became increasingly absurd and I tuned out around July 2020, and have yet to tune back in fully. I do check in with local news via Colorado Public Radio; however, I read select articles and don't listen to the broadcasts. I scroll through my interest feeds in Feedly, but not nearly as often as I did pre-pandemic. These feeds include Art, Technology, and Education - primarily. I have opened my Google News aggregate feed, but this is not often. These feeds include World, Local, Politics, Entertainment, Technology, Science, Health... etc.

4. **What drives your choice above? Convenience? Perception of validity? Perception of fairness? Entertainment value? Price? All of the above?**

    Using aggregate feeds, I have varied publishers that feed my news streams. This means I will see a variety of Headlines & Bylines and can see a fuller picture of what is being reported. These are Online publishers, some provide a limited number of free articles a month, others are unlimited. Most leading stories are covered similarly across multiple publishers; however, some stories are unique to publishers too.

5. **Does your choice for political journalism have a reputation as being "left", "right", "liberal", or "conservative" on the political spectrum? How do you know this to be the case?**

    As mentioned in the previous question, using aggregate feeds allows me to combine news sources. I have chosen publishers across the political spectrum. Yes, news sources have been labeled left, right, liberal, conservative. However, when reading the articles this is not apparent in most mainstream publishers. I suppose people who only read headlines and are looking for information to support their worldview might disagree, but when you look at the reporting on a wider spectrum this begins to disappear - I think. Then there are those independent media channels that are aggressively trying to connect to people's worldviews, unfortunately. I would not consider these reputable news sources, but I am sure others would disagree.

6. **Do you only consume journalism or news sources that are produced in the U.S. for the U.S.? Which ones? What advantages and disadvantages are there to viewing diverse journalism sources?**

    As mentioned in questions 3, 4, & 5, I consume a variety of Online media. These are aggregated from numerous sources. Sometimes publishers support the writing with audio and visual. Local news publishers, mainstream broadcast and print, or my least viewed sources. This is likely because they provide the least amount of information. I do read articles on Colorado Public Radio for local information. My Feedly feed has over 100 sources, printed in English and my Google feed has 29 sources, plus it fills in additional sources through an algorithm I presume. Print media is rare in my life, I suppose it saves trees. I do purchase books from my local independent book store.

7. **Are there ways that you feel you could be better informed? In what ways? What are alternative or supplemental news sources you could investigate to explore in the future?**

    I feel informed. I am a curious person and am looking things up all the time. I think about things and search out relevant information for what's on my mind. I suppose that would be free-thinking. Tuning to network broadcast news doesn't interest me, as mentioned in question 3. I think mainstream media is an echo chamber and has been for a long time, they are all bidding for ratings and advertising money. It was roughly twenty years ago I realized that I could flip between broadcast stations and hear nearly identical coverage, the personalities were the only thing changing. I remember even here the same stories being reported at the same time. I think a question to ask, might be, what is "news" and what makes a person informed?

## Reflection

1. <https://newslit.org/>

    - **What do you like about this resource and why?**

        I like that they have a mission statement page. However, it is oddly organized and in my opinion, not user-friendly.

    - **What could be improved?**

        The website looks nice, but after clicking on a few links and being redirected to external URLs, I gave up. I like information to be available and identified. If I spent more time registering and downloading, maybe it gets better.

    - **Is the audience applicable to the audience you are focusing on in your final project?**

        Not on the surface, so point above.

    - **Is the resource easy to navigate? Explain.**

        No, the delay in text appearing is distracting. When scanning for information, there is non there until it reveals itself. I clicked through a few lessons and received little information, a video failed to load and a reference to an external app.

2. <http://commonsense.org/>

    - **What do you like about this resource and why?**

        Cool, a site sponsored by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Neat, It has Movie, TV, and Book recommendations - with age recommendations.

    - **What could be improved?**

        As mentioned below, I missed that tabbed sectioned content and without creating an account it is hard to tell if the content is worthwhile for Adults with lower literacy levels.

    - **Is the audience applicable to the audience you are focusing on in your final project?**

        I've been on this site before and don't recall finding anything particularly relevant for me at the time as an educator. This resource is targetting parents, so maybe not my target audience of Adult Basic Educators & Programs.

    - **Is the resource easy to navigate?**

        Explain. For the most part yes, however, I am not a fan of mega-menus and that drives this site. I would have to click through every link to have a better idea of what is on this site. And to prove the point, I just realized that there are three tabs at the top breaking up the information.

3. <http://Mediasmarts.ca>

    - **What do you like about this resource and why?**

        It includes a research section with in-depth PDFs. This might be relevant for conducting research or as public service announcements.

    - **What could be improved?**

        Overall, I found this site very user-friendly. Searching the lesson plans seems to be hit or miss as far as the target age group and would take a while to find relevant materials.

    - **Is the audience applicable to the audience you are focusing on in your final project?**

        Possibly. Without diving into a full lesson review it is hard to say.

    - **Is the resource easy to navigate? Explain.**

        I  appreciate the lack of mega-menu layout that common sense utilized and that I can access the lessons without creating an account.

4. <https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/nmlit17-ela-idfakenews/identifying-fake-news/>

    - **What do you like about this resource and why?**

        I have explored PBS Learning Media in the past. It is hit or miss and an educator need to consider the students they are assigning materials to make it successful.

    - **What could be improved?**

        It took me a while to find the lesson plan associated with the images on the link and I'm still not sure if I found it without. consenting to the terms and conditions associated with the download. After downloading the resource the media the students work through is from 2016. I suppose an educator could modify the lesson for 2021.

    - **Is the audience applicable to the audience you are focusing on in your final project?**

        I know educators have been pulling from PBS Learning for some time, so yes this would be a relevant resource but more broadly, as in PBS Learn Media.

    - **Is the resource easy to navigate? Explain.**

        Not really.  Under the question of the improvement, I mentioned that the site is difficult to navigate. I suppose if I was looking for something on this site I would adjust to the layout, but for just coming in for a quick review, I found it unclear.

5. <https://newseumed.org/medialiteracy>

    - **What do you like about this resource and why?**

        I've been using this resource for a while, and used a couple of lessons from the listed library, "Is this story worth sharing" and "ESCAPE Junk News." They both have very challenging content.  If I remember correctly, one of the lessons puts students on the sleuth of whether or not a clown is real or imaginary.

    - **What could be improved?**

        I generally find the site well organized and easy to navigate.

    - **Is the audience applicable to the audience you are focusing on in your final project?**

        Since I have used this resource in the past, I would be relevant for my target audience.

    - **Is the resource easy to navigate? Explain.**

        I generally find the site well organized and easy to navigate. Clicking a link pulls up pages with focused information and isn't congested with many columns. Lessons are grouped by "grade" level, so helpful.

    - **What are your favorite and least favorite aspects of these resources?**

        Each resource is completely different, targetting different groups of people, parents, educators, or the public. It's better to have choices of information that lack information.

6. **Is there another resource that focuses on News Literacy that you can share with us?**

    Off the top of my head, I can think of http://www.perspecsnews.com. it is a UK site that pulls up three sides of a story to compare the facts. No lessons are supplied, so educators need to be creative.
