## Media Deconstruction

Numerous popular songs have explored what it means to be masculine or feminine in our culture.

Find a song, yourself, that you feel does a good job exploring masculine and feminine themes and explain what you think the song is saying.

Be sure to submit the lyrics of the song and a link to a video (if you can find one) along with a brief (a few sentences per question is fine) analysis of the song using the 5 Key Questions as your guide. Try to draw on relevant points from [Killing Us Softly 4](https://ed.ted.com/on/GnVFc9pK) (TedEd) to support and illustrate your deconstruction and interpretation of the song.

---

I selected this song primarily for the video because the video captures some of Jeanne Kilburn's criticisms of media driven gender expressions ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression)). The lyrics break down the idea that gender expressions in the binary of masculinity and femininity box people in, and at the end of the day we want to be free. Additionally, the distribution of the song further shows the nuances of today’s advertising and was likely emerging at the time of the documentary. I will attempt to peel back the many layers in this new media of advertising.

### "Be Myself" Times Square Flashmob!

1. **Who created this message?**

    Montana Tucker ft. Todrick Hall. According to [healthyceleb.com](https://healthyceleb.com/montana-tucker/), Montana Tucker began her career as a model at 8 years old. In Kilburn’s critique, this would have been attributed to advertising effects. Montana Tucker is a singer, dancer, actress, model, social media personality, and YouTuber.

    Todrick Hall is managed by Scooter Braun who is the person behind Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepson. Hall is known for video-driven projects, more than music, and has been seen in commercials for Fiat, MTV, and McDonald's, according to [healthyceleb.com](https://healthyceleb.com/todrick-hall/).

    Additionally, in the YouTube description, there is a long list of people involved in the creation of this media.

2. **Which techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    This is a pop song with a positive message and the majority of the video is shot in a storytelling manner. In fact, it is broken into two separate stories showing two different childhood tales of growing up. If the upbeat song doesn’t catch you, then maybe watching the story unfold might. Additionally, the lyrics and video incorporate a choreographed dance to accompany the song.

3. **How might different people interpret this message?**

    The song carries a strong LGBTQ+ Pride message, just look into the comment section. The song also addresses bullying and other negative behaviors that have been instilled through negative interpretations of femininity and masculinity. As Kilburn pointed out, advertising has placed emphasis on marketing a certain look and behavior for different genders. Those who don’t meet those expectations may build deep personal trauma from how others view them, also noted by Kilborn. In this case, the video goes a step further, than print media, and shows shaming and aggression as a result of this dominance and oppressive behavior.

4. **Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing?**

    This song is for the marginalized members of the community who have been forced to feel it is not acceptable to be themselves. I have included a second video of a Flash Mob gathering in Times Square to celebrate the identities and expressions that the song evokes. It is inclusive of multiple body images, genders, expressions, races, and ethnicities.

5. **Why is this message being sent?**

    The messaging likely is serving multiple purposes. First, Tucker’s and Hall’s message is about empowerment and breaking free from the stigma of social expectations, including masculine and feminine expressions.

    The second is a bit cloudier, as Tucker endorses products on social media. So this could also be tied to building a self-brand and bringing more advertisers in.

    “Montana Tucker has done endorsement work for a number of popular brands which include the likes of Ovaltine, Sketchers, BMW, and Wendys. She has also either endorsed or promoted a variety of brands through social media which include the likes of DIOSA by Seco, Dolls Kill, FILA, ADINA’S JEWELS, BFYNE, GO GET GLITTER, SugarBearHair, White Fox, REVOLVE, Harley-Davidson, Forever21, H&M, Moschino, Bumble, and good hYOUman” (n.d., [healthyceleb.com)(https://healthyceleb.com/montana-tucker/)].

    Third, this song features Todrick Hall and is closely connected in developing the empowerment message. Speculation, they may be building a future for more collaboration or supporting each other's artistic careers.

    Fourth, this song is gaining traction as a number of YouTube Zumba videos are appearing. This is due to the integration of a choreographed dance (in the video and lyrics), further promoting the song's message and branding.

## Media Use Journal

1. Count and record how many thin and non-thin women you see. Describe the clothes worn and roles played by the thin women versus the non-thin women. After you have completed this step write a reflection in your journal based on the following prompts;

    - What did you notice about the differences between how thin women were portrayed on television versus the way non-thin women were portrayed?
    - Do you think these portrayals have the power to shape how young girls and women see themselves and others? How so? How about the way that young boys and men see girls and women?
    - Eating disorder specialists cite the influence of the media as one influential factor in the development of eating disorders among young women. In what ways do you think the media supports eating-disordered attitudes and behaviors?

2. Next Count and record examples of times when a young woman, or girl, is sexualized in an advertisement. After you have completed this step write a reflection in your journal based on the following prompts;

    - What message does this image send to young girls about sex?
    - What message does this image send to young boys about sex?
    - What do you think it says to older men?

***

For this week's media use journal, I disabled ad blockers and watched about 2 hours of a YouTube Channel. I recorded the entry and exit of videos with any advertisements in between. The YouTube channel I opened happened to be primarily Live music sessions, while those that weren't live sessions used ambient visualized videography. Fort his journal entry, I will be focusing on the ads since the channel was live performances.

### Question 1

As far I saw in the channel and ads women were portrayed as middle class (dress), in roles as students, professionals, singles, couples, parents, and grandparents. The body types for most roles I would consider healthy, with grandparents moving towards overweight. The one exception would be Infinity, selling the idea of "luxury" and moving to the upper class.

**Question on reflection**

In the ads, women were portrayed in a variety of roles but I would consider them targetting the middle class. I would describe the women and men in the ads as healthy weight, with grandparents being portrayed on the heavier to obese side. In a side conversation about weight in the media, I wandered into the fashion industry and had meaningful full conversations about the changing industry. However, change is slow and some fashion brands are struggling to break out of the thin model paradigm. This industry was noted by France's ministry of health as contributing to eating disorders. A friend also chimed in and shared how when they were a model 25 years ago, they weighed about 35 pounds under their healthy weight and were considered the "right" weight. This created many health conditions at the time and are still uncomfortable with healthy body weight.

We also discussed how the majority of Americans are considered obese and how fashion sizes are getting larger to accommodate this... what was a medium is now small. Maybe this has to do with fast food and advertising, showing healthy people eating unhealthy food?

- [France bans extremely thin models](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39821036) (2017, BBC) This article points to France's efforts to try to eliminate the "thin model" expectation from continuing. As well as labeling of Photoshopped images. "The health ministry says the aim is to fight eating disorders and inaccessible ideals of beauty." The article notes France joins Italy, Spain, and Israel.
- [Skeletal models including Kaia Gerber storm YSL runaway despite fashion giant’s vow to end use of painfully thin women](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/8531185/skeletal-models-kaia-gerber-ysl-runaway-painfully-thin/) (2019, The Sun) This article discusses despite efforts and brands supporting the idea of eliminating the thin model tradition they are having a difficult time breaking from this tradition, specifically Yves Saint Laurent.

### Question 2

I did not see any sexualization of women in the ads that I viewed.

**Question on reflection**

Ads that contained women showed them in a variety of ways: single, in relationships, in families. I would consider them connecting with the emotion of happiness. In the MasterCard ad, they included LGBT relationships, the only advertiser to do this that I saw. Visit California showed an independent single woman on an adventure in California. From the ads I viewed, I see a shift in advertising from that in the past.


## Reflection

1. **Reflect upon the personal care and beauty products you use on a regular basis. What makes the advertisement for these items stay in your memory? Do you think advertising influences the kinds of products you buy? If yes, how? If no, explain why you think you’re able to resist it.**

    I am not a brand loyalist and find new products primarily on the shelves at marketplaces that I support. Some marketplaces vet the products before selling, checking product ingredients, environmental impacts, labor, and other ethical concerns. I gain insight into some products through product reviews - that I search out - and others through product recommendations. I approach both of these with an eye of skepticism, especially user reviews.

    Mostly I find new products without advertisements and will trial products because they are there. If I like the product, I will continue buying it. One example would be [Chandrika Ayurvedic Soap](https://www.auromere.com/products/chandrika-ayurvedic-soap/http://www.chandrikasoaps.com/chandrika-ayurvedic-soap.html). I picked up the soap originally because it was the cheapest at $1.00 and natural.

    I do not resist advertisements, I just am not exposed to or heavily influenced by advertisements. My only mode of consuming media is online or print. While online, I use a VPN and a Browser-based content blocker. Together, these eliminate all advertising from sight, even on advertising-based services, i.e. Google, YouTube, etc.

2. **What are some common stereotypes about feminists and feminism? Where do you think these stereotypes come from? What terms are often used for those who voice strong opinions? How might these terms serve to keep people from voicing their opinions?**

    For starters, who's common stereotypes are we considering; are we looking at the dominant White culture feminists, Latinx feminists, Black Trans feminists, female nonfeminists, or dominant media portrayal of feminism? Stereotypes will vary amongst different groups of people, time periods, and are an illogical fallacy - a misinformed social construct. The only way to answer this question is from my point of view; otherwise, I would be making a false assumption of another's viewpoint on feminism and feminists.

    Stereotypes emerge from systems of power and those seeking to maintain power, privilege, and social location. They may arise within any group. Those being oppressed may also develop stereotypes of their oppressors. Stereotypes emerge as broad generalizations based solely on perceived differences or perceived behaviors.

    Some terms used to describe those who voice strong opinions: Bitch, Dick, Leadership, Bossy, Creative, Defiant, Pushy, Obstinant, Threatening, Intimidating, Decisive, Intense, and many more... Term usage may change among groups and may be applied differently within specific communities, gender identities, sexual orientations, race, ethnicities, etc...

    All the above comes down to holding on to power.

3. **Consider and describe other social movements where people were labeled in ways that deflected attention away from the actual issues being addressed.**

    !!! quote "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)"

        COINTELPRO (syllabic abbreviation derived from Counter Intelligence Program) (1956–1971) was a series of covert and illegal projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic American political machines.

    Some groups targeted by the government operation included:

    - Feminist Movement
    - Anti-Vietnam War
    - Civil Rights Movement
    - Black Power Movement
    - American Indian Movement
    - Environmental and Animal Rights groups

    The project was carried out through numerous tactics including perjury, witness tampering & intimidation, withholding of evidence, and more. The aim of the operation was to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise, neutralize" activities carried out by the organizations (n.d., [COINTELPRO Revisited](http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/COINTELPRO/COINTELPRO-FBI.docs.html)). Methods used to fulfill the aim included: Infiltration, Psychological warfare, Harassment via the legal system, Illegal force, and undermining public opinion (n.d., [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)).

    The tactics aims and methods used by COINTELPRO are still alive and well, and have defined a playbook to disrupt current political movements and activism. One such group under disruption would be Black Lives Matter. Known FBI assessments of the organization are built and based upon anti-Black racial stereotypes (2019, [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/race-and-criminal-justice/fbi-wont-hand-over-its-surveillance-records-black)). In today's media landscape, misinformation runs rampant and serves only one purpose, to undermine public opinion (2021, [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/25/999841030/black-lives-matter-fights-disinformation-to-keep-the-movement-strong)).

4. **What are some typical expectations of femininity in our culture? Where do these expectations come from? How fair or accurate do you think they are? And how do they compare with our expectations of masculinity?**

    Feminity differs culturally and worldwide. In the U.S. femininity can relate to numerous gender identities and sexual orientations. Masculinity typically falls on straight males. The U.S. is a multicultural nation.

    Some generalized expressions of femininity and masculinity in the U.S. media may include, but are not limited to:

    |Feminine                         |Masculine                        |
    |:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
    |Hairlessness                     |Hairy                            |
    |Agreeable                        |Stubborn                         |
    |Princess (needs rescuing)        |Hero (rescuer)                   |
    |Helpless                         |Independent                      |
    |Requires specific fashion        |Requires specific fashion        |
    |Expected to primmed and ready    |Acceptable to be disheveled      |
    |Kind                             |Benevolent                       |
    |Weak                             |Strong                           |
    |Compassionate                    |Aggressive                       |
    |Endure hardships                 |Overcome hardships               |
    |Soft                             |Hard                             |
    |Pliable                          |Controlling                      |
    |Peaceful                         |Concurring                       |
    |Gentle                           |Forceful                         |
    |Relatable                        |Dominating                       |
    |stepping back                    |Taking charge                    |

    The binary of femininity and masculinity are rooted in systems of oppression used to divide and miscategorize humans - those with and without power. They place impossible expectations at both ends of the spectrum, which no gender can meet. Noting here that there are more ways to express one's identity, take androgeny for example.

    These dominant gender expression expectations can cause a disconnect with self, creating deep personal trauma, that may inhibit meaningful relationships with others. This disconnect can lead to dysfunctional behaviors. Ultimately, this binary of gender expression prevents a full expression of one's identity and divides oneself as much as they disconnect ourselves from others. It denies people from living to their full humanness.

    These expressions are cultivated within societal norms, can be culturally diverse, and are passed down within communities and families. These expectations are instilled into children at young ages to repeat the cycle.

    Some U.S. expectations of feminity include: hairlessness, agreeable, princess (needs rescuing), helplessness, requires specific fashion (expected to always look ready for ?), kind, weak, compassionate, endure, soft, pliable, peaceful, gentle, relatable, stepping back.

    Masculinity typically falls on straight males in the U.S. Expectations of masculinity concurring, dominating, controlling, hairy, strong, taking charge,
