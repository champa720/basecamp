[YouTube: Making the Cut, Season 2 (Trailer)](https://youtu.be/wHmdfVjAYnQ)

1.  **Who created this message?**

    Amazon (Amazon Prime, Amazon Video) created the trailer. Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum are executive producers, moving away from Project Runway (Bravo, Lifetime) in 2017 and began Marking the Cut in 2020. It looks as if they exited Project Runway when the studio producing it fell on hard times, being tied to The Wienstien Company and its declaration of bankruptcy. The rights of the show then bouncing to NBCUniversal. Project Runway then moved to both Lifetime and A&E Television, each partially owned by NBC (Wikipedia (Links to an external site.)). A person can speculate as to why Tim and Heidi left the show, but in interviews they noted rigid formatting, and low budget lead them to break paths from the series and develop a similar series for Amazon - Making the Cut (Refinery29 (Links to an external site.)). This new series has allowed the producers, Time Gunn and Heidi Klum) more creative liberties than the former series. As stated in an interview with Refinery29, the show has a larger budget and a platform to sell designers creations. Both of these allow the show to iterate and move forward with the theme of finding the next Global Fashion Brand. Additionally, the budget allows for the shows dynamics to change allowing designers the use of seamstresses, mimicking the real-world. In all, the message was created to publicize a new season of this updated reality television fashion design show.

2.  **What creative techniques are used to attract my attention?**

    Typical trailer effects are used. It is short (2:00) highlighting dramatic scenes with heavy bass sound effects. It alludes to drama on the reality television show, but also highlights the fashion creations to be seen throughout the series. The trailer highlights each of the judges and the fashion designers who will be in the season, and teases their personalities. The trailer also promotes the Amazon store for Making the Cut. After all the store front is an integral part of the reality television series. Bold wording draws the viewers eye to this marketing idea, "Watch it, Wear it."

3.  **How might different people understand this message differently from me?**

    Amazon is a recognizable name as a retailer and media streaming company. Most viewers will understand that this is a trailer for a reality television series. We see each of the designers at sewing machines, receiving feedback, and portions of judging. We see models on runways, and high-end settings. The audio, both musical and character outtakes, lead the viewer to see that this is a drama based reality television series and not a do-it-yourself television show or a fashion show. Viewers may be inclined to judge themselves against this reality television series, noticing what they are wearing (fashion) and imagine if fashion could lead them to these glamorous places. The whole shows premise would be completely unrelatable to those with no interest in this sort of creative expression. There is an underlying aspect of consumerism and of competition highlighted in the trailer. Viewers are enticed to search out the show on Amazon to make purchases, now and with each new episode. The winning fashion designer wins an exclusive deal with the Amazon brands plus one-million dollars for the designers brand This might inspire or give a false sense to the complexities of the fashion world to viewers - I think Shark Tank might too.

4.  **What lifestyles, values and points of view are represented in; or omitted from, this message?**

    In the trailer, diversity in the fashion industry is represented. We see fashion designers, judges, and models from varying backgrounds. Paying attention to the models, we see different body types, races, ethnicities, and genders - important since fashion as blemished history here. We hear the producers express Making the Cuts purpose, finding the next global designer brand. We can hear the Judges points of view on why they are in the show. We can hear the incentives for the fashion designers. We can see teasers of the fashion to be created during the season and the drama. Within Refinery29 interview, Tim Gunn was excited that the fashion created on the show would be available on Amazon for around $100. Making the Cut is obviously targeting an audience that is interested in fashion and/or interested in the creation textile goods. Views not related to fashion design or the fashion industry are excluded. Everyone and everything in the trailer is intentionally set and glamorized. We won't see the average persons fashion being portrayed, as that goes against the premise of the reality show - moving fashion forward.

5.  **Why is this message being sent?**

    This message is being sent to create awareness for the upcoming season of Making the Cut. It is accessible through YouTube, but most content is located on Amazon. When visiting the webpage for the show which is neatly integrated into Amazon (Amazon Prime, and Amazon Prime Video) we can see this message is about much more than just a reality television show - as is the show itself. Making the Cut is blending together reality television, consumerist culture, and media influencers into something new. We've seen this in the likes of Disney - and others - creating entertainment to sell products, but this show is reaching a different audience. It is also incorporated into one of the worlds largest retailers - Amazon. Once on Amazon, you can purchase, the show, episodes, fashion from the episode, visit influencers pages who are endorsing products buy. This message is being sent to help all those involved profit from this reality television series through viewership.


6.  **Media Artifact Interogation**

    - **What counts as violence?**

      In Making the Cut, economic disparities is ignored, showing only luxury and glamour. Aside from that, reality television in general, is known to produce drama by pitting characters against each other and overly harsh criticisms - manufacturing disfunction for drama (violence).

    - **What is made public or kept private within this message?**

      When watching the episodes we learn that the fashion designers come from a variety of backgrounds and may have had different career aspirations early on. We learn about each designers through short biographies and not all designers come from a place of privilege. In fact, since the shows premise is to find the next Global Fashion Brand, designers come from across the globe - UK, US, India, Columbia, France and Poland (Fashion United (Links to an external site.)). Each of the designers have established brands, are entrepreneurs, and have visions for where to their brands identity. Newsweek (Links to an external site.) provides an easy to digest biography of each contestant. None of this is visible in the trailer.

    - **What would be the consequence of making the reverse true?**

      Since the reality television show is about fashion and design, telling the story of designers in the trailer would not be marketing the reality factor of the show. However, finding a trailer highlighting the designers backstory may lead viewers into desiring to watch the reality television series. Changing the messaging could make the show more appealing to those with little interest in fashion design.

    - **Who benefits or loses in these differing situations?**

      Making the Cut glamorizes an already glamorous field. The reality show is designed to produce profits for a variety interests. Of course this adds to economic disparities, as profits move upward. However, Making the Cut is highlighting fashion design entrepenuaers who are all self made and following their passions/interests. The fashion industry, itself, informs what we find acceptable, fashionable, and sways what is available at clothing retailers so the shoes impacts could reach everyone.

    - ~How is violence conveyed in this message?~

    - ~Who is potentially harmed by this message?~

    - ~What does this message say about how pain should be expressed?~

    - ~Are youth portrayed as powerful or weak in this message?~

    - ~Who benefits from this portrayal?~

    - **Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value?**

      Making the Cut is designed for many interested parties to profit, including the hosts, judges, the entire production crew, the designers, Amazon, Social Media Influencers, etc. The fashion designers are creating goods to be sold on Amazon, with the incentive of winning an exclusive deal to sell their collection as an Amazon product. The reality television shows premise is to find the next global brand, this is selling the world a fashion identity. What these designer brands identify as fashionable, then trickles down to all manufactures.

    - ~Why does this advertisement/message work on a cultural level?~

    - ~What is the story that this advertisement/message tells us about how we should behave?~

    - ~What is this advertisement or message telling us about what it means to be happy?~

    - ~Is there a link between this commodity/message and happiness?~

    - **What does this advertisement convey what people want?**

      Making the Cut advertises that people desire to look good through fashion. But it also highlights the creative passions of the designers.

## Media Use Journal

1.  **How has your understanding changed since the beginning of our course?**

    Through out the course I learned that stereotypes are alive and well, a little disheartening to realize. I found insight from the "Mean World Syndrome" in that those who consume more media develop false realities more often than those who limit their media consumption. However, this is already popularized in mainstream media - it is just politicized, left, right, liberal, conservative. I feel people are aware of this idea, and when they are countered by an opposing view, they refer the opposition to a different source of information - leaning the opposite way. I am beginning to wonder if it is even possible to create unbiased news because there is always someone profiting from the exposure of the stories or someone funding the work. Besides people like trending topics and sometimes make these topics trend - so popular content will exist. But at the same time wouldn’t this be excluding voices?

2.  **Has your awareness of the power of the media shifted? In what ways?**

    I think the US or at least subcultures in the US are deeply involved in critical consciousness (sociopolitical development). I was looking at upcoming movie and television developments earlier in the year, and came across subgroups who are challenging studio choices for actors portraying characters and were successfully influencing studio choices. They were concerned that the actors should have the same background as the character, i.e. nationality (born and raised) not look. I also came across interviews with some actors questioning if roles portraying LGBTQ+ characters should be filled strictly by LBGTQ+ actors. So maybe these are examples of sociopolitical development in action to be looked at in future classes?

3.  **Do you have new concerns or feelings about media that were not present before this course?**

    The course ended with the emerging theory of sociopolitical development. My understanding is the theory is an extension of Critical Consciousness which centers on systems of oppression and action. But like I stated in the reflection, the US suffers from a disagreement of what oppression is - causing many divides. It was said either in this class or elsewhere, that if we create something there will be somebody out there who disagrees with it, feels excluded, or finds offense to it. I feel this is what we have been looking for in this course - the negatives. Is it possible to have media that clears the five essential questions? Can critical media analysis happen revealing the positives?

4.  **If you could add another week to this course, what should I have covered that we didn't address in this course?**

    If we were to add another week to class, we could investigate trending stories as a whole. I felt we looked at artistic expressions, advertising, broadcast/streaming media, but ignored a while host of works being published in popular culture. We spent the weeks using the essential five questions, but won’t these always reveal negatives? Are there frameworks available for educators, designers, and media producers to use to verify diversity, inclusion, and equity in our work? Are there more critical media formulas or frameworks to explore? We bridged into critical consciousness (sociopolitical development) at the end, but doesn’t this rely on building group collectives that share common ideals of oppression?

    I think I have additional Media Use Journal information in the reflection...

## Reflection

Watts, R.J., Griffith, D.M. & Abdul-Adil, J. (1999) Sociopolitical development as an antidote for oppression—theory and action. Am J Community Psychol 27,2. pp.255–271. <https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022839818873>

Watts, R., Hipolito-Delgado, C. (2015) Thinking ourselves to liberation?: Advancing sociopolitical action in critical consciousness. Urban Review. 47,5. pp.847-867. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11256-015-0341-x>

1.  **Describe your understanding of the concept of sociopolitical development. Using this definition as a guide, do you agree with the Watts' viewpoint that sociopolitical development is vital to human development and the creation of a just society? Why or why not?**

    Critical consciousness describes the process by which oppressed and socially marginalized people critically analyze their social and economic conditions and take action to improve them (Freire 1970) (Watts & Hipolito-Delgado, 2015).

    Sociopolitical development is the psychological process that leads to and supports social and political action (Watts et al., 2009).

    As mentioned in the quiz question similar to this reflection question, I have a difficult time distinguishing how sociopolitical development is a separate theory from the its base, critical consciousness theory. Is it in the framework or steps to develop critical consciousness? Searching this on the internet reveals little information other than it is an emerging theory - framework. In my search, I stumbled upon The National Equity Project (Links to an external site.). It appears to be full of research (Links to an external site.), resources (Links to an external site.) and frameworks (Links to an external site.) to challenge and raise awareness to systematic oppression. It lead me to the Instagram #liberatorydesign (Links to an external site.). I think this leads to my answer whether I agree with Watts' viewpoint.

    For the duration of my work within Adult Basic Education, I have instructed, developed, and implemented curriculum that would lead Adult learners to critical analysis of media presented to them. Most of this media would then be later tested through standardized testing. As a result, often times we would have to also instruct test taking strategies for the standardized tests. There are several reasons for this need. One that stands out, in light of this question, is that students critical analysis doesn't always align to the analysis that the standardized test is expecting. Standardized testing, in itself, is a separate discussion; but it does tie into the idea of developing critical consciousness which standardized testing may discourage.

    Moving externally, from the classroom to community, I have found discourse supports the notion that sociopolitical development is necessary. When speaking about systematic oppression it is easy to remove oneself from it impacts. Example would be talking to a person who doesn't understand that they carry privilege; they themselves are impoverished. How could they have privilege? But when building from their experience and critically looking at the affects of their environment, they may begin to see how they are viewed differently than others around them. Discussing different experiences does, in fact, reveal privilege that others do not have. In my mind, this is developing critical consciousness (sociopolitical development). Of course, this is actionable if the person who is gaining new insights is willing to release that privilege they carry or challenge the system that is supporting inequality.



2.  **With the incredible news cycle we have been experiencing in the last few months, these articles speak to the important and crucial role that media literacy plays in developing citizenship skills. How does this notion connect to the Watts' article on sociopolitical development?**

    With our current news cycles I found insight to this phenomenon from the documentary, "The Mean World Syndrome."  After viewing the documentary, I walked away with the understanding that those who take in more information from media channels begin to develop false realities based on those channels. The connection I inferred from this idea is that those who are overly consumed by medias, have less time to actually interact with those around them. Thinking back to 2020, we were in a great isolation period and to this day some are still not connected people around them. It was my thinking that this is how peoples perceptions became so divided - or rather exasperated the divide. Those that were at one time connected to those around them and community, had lost that connection. Some relied heavily on media networks to keep them in the loop - creating false media realities. Others found Social Media networks to be their new friend and joined in the trends of eating, baking, workouts, etc. To this extent, we are influenced by what we interact with - peer pressure comes to mind here.

    One thing I haven't figured out, is who's view of reality is the correct one, especially when looking through the lens of critical consciousness (sociopolitical development). There is not an agreement of what oppression is in the US at large. Citizens grapple with the complexities of where rights end and where others' rights begin. I had a colleague describing a diversity, equity, and inclusion training that first focused on LGBTQ+ inclusion, then was followed by faith inclusion. The faith based speaker felt they were no longer "safe" and "closeted" in their workplaces because of the others inclusion. The answer seems obvious to me that all people belong, but some have deep engrained points of view of what is right vs. wrong. The fact that stereotypes are still a driving narrative in media shows that we haven't moved to the point of allowing others to exists as who they are, in peace. Besides marketers forming profiles of who people are, we also have hate groups to contend with. Each placing people into boxes and perpetuating forms of oppression.

    With sociopolitical development, it is intended to engage the viewer in critical analysis of their environments. The Young Warriors program entered the study with an interesting view of rap music and the entertainment the young people engaged with. However, with media interrogation, or leading questions, the researchers were able to have the students vocalize oppression in their surroundings. But then again, this oppression was already vocalized in music and entertainment being questioned - without verifying the media used in the program, this assumption is based on my knowledge of 90s rap music. Therefore the students made it known to the researchers that the oppression in the media was in fact in their experiences and communities too. I suppose the sociopolitical questions removed the glamorization of the entertainment industry, but wouldn't this be exposing economic disparities? Like most growing up, the young people saw those who had things that were unattainable to them, unfortunately this extended beyond material things and into being stable and part of a safe community - I can relate there. But was rap music perpetuating this oppression, or other factors? Since the 90s, and earlier, we have seen a changing force within rap most notably from the hip-hop counter-culture, driving positivity back into the messaging.

    So how does all this work with our current news cycles, when what I read and see in media doesn't align to what I hear and see out my front door? When I have friends who tell me about their experiences and when I share them no one believes that the experience could be true. Is it because they aren't connected to the place of events? Or because it's not popularized in the news cycle? Or a combination of both. I see one crucial element missing in developing a critical consciousness (sociopolitical development), in that we need to first agree one what oppression is and who is being oppressed? I feel the US has many differing views on this currently. If we are to be critically looking at media and analyzing how it is perpetuating oppressive processes, don't we need to have a common idea of oppression? Or would this be informed by the collective process of sociopolitical development?
