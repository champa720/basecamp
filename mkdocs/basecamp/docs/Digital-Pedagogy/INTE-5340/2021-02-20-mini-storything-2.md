## Assignment

Now that you're part of a tribe, show some pride by designing your own tattoo that is symbolic of your tribe's culture. Step 1: Pick out an icon or set of icons at the Noun Project Website and remix it into your own unique design and post it to the # Mini-things channel. Here's the catch, don't let the other teams know your team's name. Step 2: Try to guess what the other team's name is through astute analysis.

## Backstory

Alright, a remix... I choose to export SVG from the noun project and began in Canva. As I started to layer icons, I needed to be able to hide pieces of them... I tried hiding things with boxes in Canva, but that quickly became unreasonable. So, I searched out another editor... and found [Boxy SVG Editor](https://boxy-svg.com/). It is very similar to Adobe Illustrator; however, some aspects seemed simplified - in a good way... so this worked great for remixing the icons from the noun project.

I actually found many icons representing my tribe - by name - but I selected alternative icons to not give anything away in the Attribution text. I spent a couple hours searching & remixing together icons to tell a little visual story. The whole mini-thing was created using only remixed icons. I might have started having to much fun stitching together the icons... Can you guess my tribes name?
