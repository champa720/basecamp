# Mental Health, Relationships, And Sex: Exploring Patterns Among Bisexual Individuals In Mixed Orientation Relationships

[DRAFT] 

In the United States, sex is omnipresent in advertising, music, movies, and television, but when it comes to talking about sex in public spaces — education and workplaces — it is a censored or taboo topic. Currently, sex and sexual orientation is not openly discussed in education, while legislation is actively casting shadows on the subject. The inability to openly discuss sex and sexual orientations has a negative impact on the LGBTQ+ community, but may also generally effect the United States’ perceptions of sex and sexual orientations. When considering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), as well as Trauma Informed Practices in education and workplaces, there may be a need to understand minority stresses and the relationship to mental health. In this study, researchers Jennifer A. Vencill, Samantha Carlon, Alex Iantaffi, and Michael Miner seek to expand the empirical literature concerning bisexual mental health; a population high in numbers but under represented in research (2017). Since few studies currently exist, the researchers did not enter a hypothesis, since no prior studies were known at the time, but did set parameters for inquiry.

# Synopsis

Empirical literature surrounding bisexual mental health, relationships, and sex is under represented in sexual health reasearch. Previous research primarily surrounds HIV/AIDS and sexualy transmitted infections (STIs), leaving a gap in liturature concerning bisexual experiences, specifically experiences concerning mental health. It was noted, that individuals identifying as bisexual are the single greatest sexual minority, comprised of an estimated four million people in the United States. The study consisted of a small population (53) self-identitfying as bisexual recruited through flyers at local gathering spots and through social media. Participants were additionally required to be in a mixed orientation relationship, i.e. with partners not identifying as bisexual. This information was collected as part of the prescreening process utilizing a Qualtrics survey before moving to the quantitative portion of the study.

The study utilized several qualitative measures, each are considered to have high-reliability scales. Measures included, Bisexual Identity Index (BII), Daily Heterosexist Experiences Questionaire (DHEQ), Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionaire (CSFQ-14), New Sexual Satisfaction Scale (NSSS), Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21).

The minority stress framework was cited as consistently supporting "the link between sexual orientation-related minority stressors and negative mental health outcomes" (Vencill et al., 2017, The present study, para. 2). Three minority stress variables were selected as possible mediators — mechanisms or processes — between mental health and relationship outcomes: (1) Isolation, inability to find meaningful relationships within the LBGTQ community and others; (2) Vigilance, the effects of anti-LBGTQ attitudes/behaviors; and (3) Vicarious Trauma, learning of lived experiences surrounding LGBTQ predjudice and discrimination.

It was concluded that Isolation and Vicarious Truama were significant mediating variables connecting bisexual identites and mental health. Where Isolation mediated depression (50%), anxiety (31%), and stress (26%), while Vicarious Trauma mediated identity affirmation and anxiety (82%). To note, Vicarious Trauma includes "anti-LGBTQ slurs, jokes, discrimination, or hate crimes" (Vencill et al., 2017, Discussion, para. 3). Additionally, it was discussed that the population is affected by a unique minority stressor, binegativity, which affects the mental health and relationships for bisexual identifying individuals.

The study concluded that "bisexual individuals need to be connected to support and resources that specifically affirm their sexual orientation" (Vencill et al., 2017, Discussion, para. 3).

## Strengths

Concise explanations of each measure/scale were provided, as well as a sample question from measure/scale that participants answered. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge the limitations of their study and made suggestions for further research into the issue. Limitations included, acknowledging the lack of diversity (identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomics) of the participants. Even with the limitations of study, the conclusions reached are significant in the larger context of the purpose for the study, expanding sexual health literature pertaining to bisexuals and mental health.

## Critique

As noted in the strengths section, and acknowledge by the authors, expanding the literature on the health for those identifying as bisexual is much needed. For a sexual minority group estimated to include four million, a sample size of fifty-three seems inadequate; however the findings are supported by a larger research base surrounding individuals identifying as lesbian or gay. The authors also disclosed that the selection criteria may have faults, perpetuating binegativity and bisexual stereotypes, which coincidently are minority stressors for those participating. Conflicts of interest were also disclosed in the study.

## Best Uses

In thinking about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, as well as Trauma Informed Practices, it is relevant to understand minority stressors that affect the mental health of others. Beyond mental health, understanding how others are perceived in the world and how those perceptions affect them adds a layer of empathy to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Moving forward, looking more into the minority stress framework may provide support, understanding, and insight.
