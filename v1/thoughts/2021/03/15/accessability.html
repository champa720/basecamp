      <p>Have you ever had a sticky door lock? You know the ones where no matter how hard you try to turn the key, it just won’t turn. We’ve all been there and tried all sorts of maneuvers to get it to lock or unlock, jiggling the door, pushing and turning the lock, pulling and turning the lock. We might have even gone for a pair of pliers or a wrench and ended breaking the key! I remember walking my sister through how to unlock my door when they were housesitting for me. The lock was so tight she thought I had given her the wrong key.</p>

<p>Anyways, I follow many design blogs and came across an article about a simple redesign. It’s one of those simple iterations that make you think, why hasn’t this already been done? Let me introduce you to the <a href="http://www.nendo.jp/en/works/l-door-key/">Nendo Key</a>.</p>

<p>It’s one of those simple redesigns that potentially can improve life for many with disabilities. Think of those with poor vision no longer have to fumble with the key to find the right direction. Or those with mobility issues no longer having to struggle with the poor leverage of a standard key. Or any of us with a stubborn lock. And that’s what accessibility is all about, finding solutions that create better experiences for all.</p>
