      <p>Program Segment: Corrections</p>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>

<p>Nadine was working as a case manager and job coach for formerly incarcerated men and women while earning their bachelors and master’s degrees. They also obtained a Teacher License for Elementary Education (Grades: K-6); but soon after they felt a calling to return back to Adult Education. Nadine stated, “After all, there is a generational problem; if the parents aren’t doing well, the children aren’t doing well.”</p>

<p>Nadine taught Adult Education classes at two non-profit agencies before transitioning into a corrections setting to teach Adult Education classes. They have experience teaching Adult Education classes for the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) and a College Preparatory curriculum for the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility (DWCF).</p>

<p>When Nadine was asked “what is unique about your specific reality”, they responded by stating, “My students are incarcerated…” Nadine continued to explain why their learners are incarcerated and the benefits that their instruction provides. Nadine identified a loss of conventional and effective learning opportunities in the learners’ past as a common cause leading to the learners incarceration. It is their belief that through Adult Education classes their students not only obtain basic educational skills but also acquire self-esteem and confidence when they experience success in the classroom. Nadine see’s these outcomes leading incarcerated learners to develop workplace skills and into career training which ultimately leads to meaningful employment and a decrease in the probability of returning to prison.</p>

<h2 id="immersion">Immersion</h2>

<p>Nadine has many roles within their organizational setting, and as such values their personal time. They expressed sheer joy at their new work schedules which now include 4 10-hour days. Nadine maintains a network of community agencies that provide services to help aid people reentering society, in addition to their direct instruction responsibilities. Currently, their classrooms are transitioning back to small in-person sessions on an alternating block schedule.</p>

<p>To fully immerse into the CDOC, Nadine points to the organization’s mission, which in part states, “holding offenders accountable and engaging them in opportunities to make positive behavioral changes and become law-abiding, productive citizens.” Again, Nadine expresses joy in the fact that the CDOC is moving from punitive practices to teaching, counseling, and guiding practices. Conversely, Nadine feels that the CDOC has an ingrained militaristic nature and a chain of command which adds frustration when new ideas are not heard or are outright ignored.</p>

<h2 id="connection">Connection</h2>

<p>Nadine is a dedicated professional with a working knowledge of classroom technology that does not depend on the internet, which inmates are not allowed to access. This is a point of frustration which prevents Nadine from building new skills related to technology and inhibits their learner’s from practicing and developing essential workplace skills. But like most educators, Nadine can be very innovative and makes the most of the equipment and supplies they do have.</p>

<p>Nadine has a personal desire to learn to use modern web applications and to improve their instructional abilities through improved lesson design. As the CDOC is placing more emphasis on standards based instruction, as well as career and technical education, these changes also become a learning opportunity for Nadine. They expressed this transition has added pressure and they receive little support internally.</p>

<p>Training needs extend beyond growth in skills and knowledge for Nadine and move into environmental problems. They encounter daily frustrations, internal conflicts, and work-place politics. All these can be daunting, demoralizing, and can affect their disposition in the classroom. It would be helpful to have training in areas of coping and self-care. Having worked in similar stressful environments, internal team building may also help improve this working environment.</p>

<h2 id="detachment">Detachment</h2>

<p>Moving forward with Student Ambassadors, Nadine would face an uphill battle. A new program not conforming to practice implemented by the chain of command may be a challenge. However, Nadine has a desire to learn new instructional strategies, is dedicated to serving their learners, and CDOC goals are shifting to better prepare student learners for reentry. This combination of alignments to Student Ambassadors may allow aspects of it to develop. We would need to ensure the learning objectives, included in our design, are clearly aligned to and support College and Career Readiness Standards in order to be successful in the CDOC.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may consider incorporating <a href="https://www.schoolcounselor.org/school-counselors/publications-position-statements/career-conversation-starters">Career Conversations</a>, published by the American School Counselor Association, into the list of topics supported through the Student Ambassador program. This may help CDOC buy into the program through more explicit development of workplace related skills, in turn supporting Nadine.</p>

<p>Nadine may best benefit from live training, allowing them to network in person with like minds, and may bring a breath of fresh air in comparison to their organizational environment. The downside to a live training is it may reduce access for other programs to participate, as this is a state-wide program. However, Nadine also has a desire to improve their personal digital literacy skills which could be supported through an online platform. Through virtual training, our design should contain an element of synchronous learning in order to best support Nadine. In designing for Nadine, I would see either learning solution benefiting them.</p>

<p>When stepping back and considering learning objectives for the Student Ambassadors program, the learning solution needs to include instructional strategies and practices in order to support Nadine. We would also need to ensure those objectives help meet the overall Student Ambassador program goals. This would allow the Student Ambassador program to be flexible enough to support both programs and student learners, having the maximum impact and advocacy outreach.</p>
