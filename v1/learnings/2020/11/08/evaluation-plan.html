      <p>The purpose of evaluating the Ambassador Leaders program is to determine the effect its implementation has on Adult Educators’ instructional strategies and, ultimately, it’s resulting in advocacy. With Colorado-based adult education’s professional development lacking, the adult learners themselves are also suffering. The proposed Ambassador Leaders program will work towards rectifying this problem. This evaluation process will assess if the Ambassador Leaders program is meeting the high-level program outcomes of relevant professional development for adult educators and facilitate further development and refinement of the program.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection-and-analysis-plan">Data collection and analysis plan</h2>

<p>Data collected throughout the Ambassador Leaders program will be evaluated using the four levels of the New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM). Data will be collected through adult educator participation, learner self-reflection, post-learning feedback, and interviews. These results will be evaluated to improve the Ambassador Leaders program.</p>

<p>Formative learner evaluations will take place throughout each phase, informing the effectiveness of the program. In the final program phase, a summative assessment will take place, asking the learners to demonstrate how they are implementing the instructional strategies they have discovered through the program.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-schedule">Evaluation schedule</h2>

<p>Evaluation and revision will occur once each Ambassador Leaders cycle is completed. Once completed, the collected data will be evaluated and analyzed to determine needed revisions to the next Ambassador Leaders cycle.</p>

<h2 id="new-world-kirkpatrick-model">New World Kirkpatrick Model</h2>

<p>Developed in the 1950s, the Kirkpatrick Model has become an industry standard for program evaluation. As professional learning has evolved, so has the model. It was revised last in 2016, taking on the name New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM) (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.).</p>

<h3 id="level-4-results">Level 4: Results</h3>

<p>“The degree to which targeted outcomes occur as a result of the training and the support and accountability package” (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.).
In the NWKM, Level 4 evaluates how professional learning impacts the organization and helps meet its mission and the program goal. This level of evaluation will utilize aggregated data through phases 3 &amp; 4 and aim to assess learning outcomes of objectives 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1.</p>

<p>Mission statement: The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, CAEPA, provides leadership to the field of adult education and family literacy by offering opportunities for professional development, advocacy, and resource sharing to improve the quality of life for every Coloradan (Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, n.d., Mission Statement).</p>

<p>Ambassador Leaders goal: Through participation in Ambassador Leaders, Colorado adult educators will have reliably demonstrated the ability to use high impact practices and knowledge of advocacy strategies for the community, district, state, and national levels.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado’s adult education programs, educators, and students</li>
  <li>Objective 3.2: The learner will select appropriate high impact practices that promote student’s skill-building, self-awareness, agency, and self-efficacy.</li>
  <li>Objective 4.1: The learner will build safe and inclusive learning environments utilizing skills gained through Ambassador Leaders.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="level-3-behavior">Level 3: Behavior</h3>

<p>“The degree to which participants apply what they learned during training when they are back on the job”(The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.).</p>

<p>A goal of the Ambassador Leaders professional development is for an instructional change.</p>

<p>At the end of phase 3, learners will reflect on their work practices before and after the course. This will provide evaluation data on how their behaviors were affected by this experience. This contributes to the evaluation objective 3.2.</p>

<p>During phase 4, a post-learning interview will be conducted. Learners are asked to share the changes they have implemented in their instruction based on their professional learning and share successes and struggles. This contributes to the evaluation objective 3.1 and 4.1</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado’s adult education programs, educators, and students</li>
  <li>Objective 3.2: The learner will select appropriate high impact practices that promote student’s skill-building, self-awareness, agency, and self-efficacy.</li>
  <li>Objective 4.1: The learner will build safe and inclusive learning environments utilizing skills gained through Ambassador Leaders.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="level-2-learning">Level 2: Learning</h3>

<p>“The degree to which participants acquire the intended knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence and commitment based on their participation in the training” (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.).</p>

<p>During phase 1, learners will gain knowledge about Ambassador Leaders and will be assessed through retrieval based questions during the registration process. This evaluates objectives 1.1 and 1.2.</p>

<p>During phase 2, learners will gain knowledge on advocacy, instructional strategies, and high-impact strategies and will be assessed through a self-reflection of newly gained information within the microlearning course. This evaluates objective 2.1.</p>

<p>During phase 3, learners will participate in a microlearning forum and be provided a learning reflection survey about the course, within the microlearning course. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 3.1.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objective 1.1: The learner will define what Ambassador Leaders are.</li>
  <li>Objective 1.2: The learner will explain how the Ambassador Leaders model is an extension of the national adult education Student Ambassador model.</li>
  <li>Objective 2.1: The learner will contribute to Ambassador Leaders through forums, training, and advocacy efforts.</li>
  <li>Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado’s adult education programs, educators, and students</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="level-1-reaction">Level 1: Reaction</h3>

<p>“The degree to which participants find the training favorable, engaging and relevant to their jobs” (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.).</p>

<p>During phase 1, reaction data will be collected through the results of enrollment and attendance of the Ambassador Leaders training. This will enable an analysis of the education context, experience, and personal learning goals of participants. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 2.1 and 3.1.</p>

<p>During phase 2, the learners’ reaction to the microlearning experience will also be gathered within the microlearning course. This data will help guide changes to future microlearning course opportunities. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 2.1.</p>

<p>During phase 3, learners will be provided a course feedback questionnaire within the microlearning course. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 3.1.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objective 2.1: The learner will contribute to Ambassador Leaders through forums, training, and advocacy efforts.</li>
  <li>Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado’s adult education programs, educators, and students</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plan-for-revision-cycle">Plan for revision cycle</h2>

<p>Revision based on NWKM Level 1 data will be driven by the participation in Ambassador Leaders professional development opportunities. To determine low participation, we will compare the total who participated in an estimated total of adult educators, creating a ratio. Low participation will result in revision work of the CAEPA marketing and media campaign, as well as course content.</p>

<p>Revisions for NWKM Level 2 will be based on course feedback. Data will be collected at the end of the microlearning course. If the course is determined to be ineffective or if learners share their LMS experience was not ideal, the course content will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Revisions for NWKM Level 3 will be based on questionnaire feedback, forum participation, and learning application reflection. Based on results, adjustments will be made to course content, collaboration opportunities, and/or application opportunities.</p>

<p>Revisions at level NWKM Level 4 is a culmination of all underpinning levels of evaluation, meeting the overall program goals and objectives. If these are not being met, then further analysis of the previously collected data will take place to guide revision.</p>

<h2 id="plan-for-communication-of-results">Plan for communication of results</h2>

<p>Communication of evaluation results will be shared at the organization’s monthly board meeting. Raw data will be collected and shared a week in advance of the meeting so board members can review the data beforehand. Additional stakeholders may be invited to the meeting for additional input.</p>
