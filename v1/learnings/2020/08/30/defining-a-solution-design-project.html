<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Insider knowledge has provided two potential problems to design solutions for. One, supporting the organization in designing a course to support an advocacy effort called Student Ambassadors. The second, designing on-boarding and training for the organizations new / current board members. Since we were unable to identify a third member by the deadline, we have yet to determine which option to design and were looking for feedback to proceed.</p>

<p>Both projects would support the organization, either externally or internally.</p>

<ul>
  <li>External learners would be Adult Education (AE) programs and instructors. Learners may not be familiar with CAEPA’s advocacy efforts, and the organization lacks a Colorado specific Student Ambassador training. We could help support the organization by designing a training to move external learners into being informed organizers and implementers of local Student Ambassadors program.</li>
  <li>Internal learners would be the board members themselves. Learners are currently professionals in their field and could be better informed as professionals on the board. This could be accomplished through improved onboarding, and internal training.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="student-ambassadors">Student Ambassadors</h2>

<p>We’ve identified a skills and learning gap amongst AE programs and instructors. We would propose to design and develop a Colorado specific Student Ambassadors training course to support the organization (CAEPA) in effectively starting a local Student Ambassadors program. Content may include guidance in creating ambassador groups, materials for AE program and instructors, and support the development of a unified advocacy message. It’s been noted that an outline for Student Ambassadors has been created at the federal level through an affiliate organization COABE, and our project aims to design a Colorado specific training, see <a href="https://coabe.org/student-ambassador">COABE Student Ambassadors</a>, and <a href="https://coabe.org/ambassador-training">COABE Ambassador Training</a>.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding">Onboarding</h2>

<p>The organization suffers from a lack of a clear onboarding processes and procedures. We would propose to design and develop a clear onboarding objective, to ensure new board members are aware of board procedures, bylaws, resources, advocacy background, and current advocacy efforts. It’s been noted that CAEPA has struggled with board member retention, training for executive roles, and lack documentation for responsibilities when committee groups have formed.</p>

  <li>Colorado has identified 321,000 Adults lacking basic skills to advance in the workplace, and 126,000 Adults lacking basic English skills to advance (<a href="https://educateandelevate.org/Colorado/">Educate &amp; Elevate</a>).</li>
  <li>All in Federal and State, an adult learner is supported by $838 compared to $10,000 in elementary education ([Educate &amp; Elevate)(https://educateandelevate.org/Colorado/)].</li>
  <li>Colorado was the last state in the union to receive state funding, in 2014, and has one of the lowest state contributions of one-million dollars (<a href="https://www.nationalskillscoalition.org/news/blog/colorado-passes-the-adult-education-act">National Skills Coalition</a>).</li>
