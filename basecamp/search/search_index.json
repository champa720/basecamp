The message is to notify readers that a new food establishment is in town to gain customers. Media Use Journal \u00b6 This week track your media usage every day for three days in a row. First, write down your most used platform or channel - writing down what you use it for. Continue to add more channels and platforms, ranking them in order of use how often and for what reasons you use each type of media or media channel. You can complete your journal entry one of three ways. My media channels applications listed from most used Daily overview \u00b6 I use my technology pretty much the same way daily. I start my day at my desktop, where I primarily use the Brave Browser with the uBlock Origin extension. This combination blocks nearly all advertisements from my view and even blocks YouTube ads. I generally navigate to listen to music while having morning coffee. I look up whatever may be on my mind that morning in the browser. I check in on Slack channels and check my email. I also open up Canvas and complete readings and class meetings. I do not use Social Media, except for LinkedIn, and do not check in often these days. Music generally plays throughout my day. I have stopped following the \"News\" as it tends to be negative, so that is no longer part of my daily routine. June 7 - June 12, 2021 \u00b6 Mac mini Browsers (Brave and Safari): Web browsing and online shopping. I use it for job and internship searching. It also connects me to Canvas for classwork. Slack: I use this to talk to friends, network, and for class discussions daily. YouTube Music: My go-to source for music. Since I use a content blocker, the advertisement-based service has zero advertisements. And it is free. This is technically a browser-based application. Disk Drill: This is disk recovery software that I have been using to recover data from old hard disk drives, as I migrate them to a new solid-state drive network-attached storage. Grammarly: I use this application when drafting out responses to just about everything. I like the simplicity of having my grammar checked, but it is also distracting for first drafts. Zoom: The official UC Denver meeting application. Currently, I have one class that holds weekly Wednesday afternoon meetings. During the meeting, we are updated with weekly lesson objectives and complete groupwork synchronously here. If someone is unable to attend the work becomes asynchronous and is submitted to a Canvas discussion. Adobe Creative Cloud: I produce media, both for class and independently. I primarily open up Illustrator and Photoshop to complete projects. This week I created a logo in Illustrator but also needed to convert some images using Photoshop. I also do video editing, but not this week. iPhone Browsers (Brave, Safari, Firefox Focus): When I am out and about, sometimes I feel the need to look stuff up. Depending on what it is, I use the browser that provides the layer of privacy I desire for the search. Safari has the lowest protection. Brave and Firefox Focus are about equals here. Firefox Focus doesn't retain any cookies or history, so for general searches, this is my go-to browser, followed by Brave. When sites \"are broken\" from the privacy-centric browsers, I switch to Safari. YouTube Music app: I listen to music while I am out and about. Since I only travel by bicycle or by walking, it's the perfect time to listen to music. Canvas Student app: I check in on class assignments while out walking or sitting in the park. Refresh my mental to-do list; so I can reflect and prepare. Slack app: I use this primarily to talk to friends and check in on class challenges on the go. Gmail: Personal email service - This opens links into browsers that look like additional apps, but are just email messages. Shazaam: When I hear a song I want to remember and it isn't playing on my device, I use this app. Messages app: I talk to friends and family through text messaging. Phone app: I rarely use the phone app, ironic. Reflection \u00b6 What are your interests outside of school, work, and this class? Ah, the work-life balance question. I enjoy getting outside for bicycle rides - to nowhere - and spending time in the parks around me here in Denver, CO. Aside from that, I like to make media! I'm an artist and enjoy working in a variety of media. From India ink and watercolor to charcoal. I also enjoy working in three dimensions (sculpture). I've spent quality time learning web development and enjoy working in digital media as well. Tell us about yourself, family, pets, hobbies, passions. I live in Denver, CO. I love cats, but currently am petless. See question 1 for hobbies and passions. But to extend this, I would also include work. I enjoy working in education, supporting others, and seeking to work for a mission-driven organization that I can get behind. Where are you in terms of your academic or education journey? I began the LDT Masters program in Fall 2020. At this point, I am halfway through, and after this Summer, I am planning for Fall to be my final semester. How did you come to enroll in this course? This course is part of the required courses for the new Digital Pedagogy and New Literacies certificate, Fall 2021. To keep with my anticipated graduation, I enrolled in the class, pre-update. Have you worked or are you currently in a library, school, or working in education? What grade/level? In what capacity? Until August of 2020, I was working in Adult Basic Education for the last 10+ years as an Instructor, Distance Learning Coordinator, and ultimately Program Coordinator. Unfortunately, planned federal funding cuts eliminated my program during 2020. I am currently sitting president for CAEPA, Colorado's professional organization supporting Adult Education programs through advocacy, professional learning, and resource sharing. What do you feel are the \"hot topics\", \"buzz words\", or trends in education today? I think diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) may be the current buzzwords gaining attention. What do you hope to gain from this course? I would like to continue gaining insight into Media. Continuing from my last class in Learning with Social Media (which has now been eliminated). After this first week, I'm intrigued by the weekly media deconstructions, and then applying this to media constructions. What topics do you hope we cover? I would hope to cover some \"hot topics\" and \"buzzwords\" that we all mention. What does it mean to be \"media literate\"? Having gained insight into this from the first-week coursework, it would mean critically thinking about media and becoming an active and aware participant in the conversation. This idea aligns well with past lessons I created and taught on Media Literacy, whereas the focus of the lesson looked very similar to that of the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy in the Ted-Ed lesson. What does the term \"media literacy\" mean to you? My feelings on media literacy align well with the previous question and the 5 Key Questions. I believe media literacy is acknowledging that media has a purpose, target audience, and a reason it was created. To naturally question and critically think about the intentions of media, is media literacy.","title":"Critcal Media Literacy"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-06-13-overview/#media-deconstruction","text":"To complete your Week 1 Media Deconstruction Assignment watch this video that describes how to use the 5 Key Questions to complete a media deconstruction.

In this Discussion Thread, post the link to the advertisement along with your Media Deconstruction using the 5 Key Questions as your guide. In this week's analysis, I want you to focus on the context of the time in history that the message was being sent. For example, the toys being targeted to me as a child in the 1970s had very different messaging due to the political and social expectations of the time. When you talk about the creator of the message, think about that company in the context of that moment in history. I'm submitting numerous images from a December 1988 magazine called BMX Plus! I remember having a subscription to this magazine and desiring just about anything from inside. I wanted a \"real\" bicycle, but we could not afford one. My bicycle at the time was my Uncle's old BMX bike, store brand. I later inherited my Father's store-brand mountain bike that he no longer rode. I later bought a used BMX bicycle at a Garage Sale, but it wasn't any manufacture featured in this magazine - so think huffy - noncompetitive. I wanted a bicycle I could ride in competitions. I was thinking about this magazine, and in its entirety could be considered one giant advertisement. Perhaps, similar to that of today's influencer. I say that because the magazine interviews professional riders, about the history, tips & tricks, and their gear. This connects the reader to personalities, but also products. For this deconstruction, I will critically look at the final image in the image list. BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Cover) BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Advertisment 1) BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Back) BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Advertisment 2) Who created this message? This advertisement was created by the GT Bicycle Company. To quote, \"BMX was the foundation for the GT empire. It was our foray into bikes and drove the passion we are lucky enough to follow every day. The current GT BMX Lineup is designed to fuel your fire and get you stoked on going bigger, faster, and further\" ( GT Bicycles ). GT Bicycles were founded in 1972 and were a key player in spreading the BMX bicycle. Throughout the 80s, GT acquired several up-and-coming brands to form its empire; However in the 90s as interest in the sport declined the company was sold off and made public ( Wikipedia ). Which techniques are used to attract my attention? It's a full spread - filling two pages. This makes it impossible for the reader not to catch a glimpse of it. The ad also captures the aesthetic of the magazine with a large, stop motion, image mimicking the actual articles in the magazine. How might different people interpret this message? As a kid, I would see the images of the bicycles in the lower-left corner and desire them to be able to do the trick above. Parents may see the trick above and have mixed feelings about allowing their child to perform such a thing. Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? The entire magazine is targetting those who are interested in BMX. This advertisement is targetting a specific subsection of the sport and looks to be flatland or half-pipe riders. The gender is hidden behind the protective gear but could be assumed to be male, as they dominate the ads. Flipping through the magazine and viewing several articles and advertisements, the sport was included multiple genders, races, and ethnicity. The sport also extended beyond the U.S. territory, as seen in issues highlighting BMX worldwide. Why is this message being sent? This advertisement is being sent to endorse the GT Bicycle company. Often times the text not only highlights their product but also features a snippet about one of their sponsored riders. So advertisements would typically endorse the team and the products the team uses. Media Use Journal \u00b6 This week I would like you to reflect upon your childhood and how adver!sers found you. What are the most memorable toys that you played with as a child? What do you remember most about those toys? This has been a challenging question for me this week, as I do not recall having much as a child growing up. I do remember that most of my toys were gifted to me through hand-me-downs or hand-made. My parents were young, even by today's standards. It wasn't until late elementary - 5th or 6th grade / 1989 or 1990 - that I recall shopping for toys. So early in my youth, I remember my mother sewing me \"Carebears\" made from patterns at the fabric store. I also remember my Grandmother making me a \"Cabbage Patch\" doll. Well, she made one for everyone in the family, but mine was special. My Grandfather made me several wooden gifts in his woodshop. One such gift was homemade lincoln logs. I remember I would stack and build structures from these and try new designs. There were no instructions or pictures included, so everything had to come from my imagination. I remember having a whole bunch of second-hand legos gifted to me. The legos were those of my three uncles' combined sets. These were brought to me in some sort of large container, again with no instructions or pictures. I had to build everything from my imagination. Today, this would look like that Lego TV show that challenges participants to build things, while kids watch. I also remember one of my Uncles gifting me his BMX bike. This gift may have sparked my interest in bicycles that I carry to this day. I remember riding it through the trailer park and behind the junkyard to some dirt track. There were other kids there. I suppose they were from the neighborhood. We moved often, so I didn't know anybody. I would've been early elementary, maybe 3rd or 4th grade? Anyway, I remember riding on that dirt track. Overcoming the fear of the steep hills and speeding around. I remember being encouraged by others that were there. That is memorable. I remember playing with all these things at different points of my childhood, as we moved from place to place. I never thought anything of them being gifted, hand-me-downs, or homemade. I don't ever remember having a desire for anything other than what I had. How did you get the toys? Were they gifts? Did someone buy them for you? If you know, where were they purchased? Do you have a memory of purchasing the toy? I remember shopping for \"Carebear\" fabric with my mother at a young age. I don't recall the television show at all, which came out in 1985. There were many patterns to choose from; we selected two or three Carebear patterns. I remember we choose by color and their symbols. We probably made up our meanings for the bears, seems like the thing we would have done. So no marketing influence my decision-making. I remember my Mother sewing them together for me and I helped stuff them. These Carebears joined me with my other stuffed animals that I had collected as gifts. I don't remember ever going to the store and buying any stuffed animals, and yet somehow I had like 50 of these things by late elementary school. They kept me company in my bed and bedroom right up to High School. I then passed them onto my new step-siblings, carrying the tradition forward. Everything else in my early elementary days where gifts. It wasn't until late elementary that I remember going to a store and buying toys, and that happened not frequently. I also remember receiving IOUs as gifts because we couldn't afford the toys at the store, yep. Do you remember any TV advertisements for the specific toys you are writing about? If not, was there some other reason behind your desire for the toy? Yeah... like I said in other discussions, this topic is really hard for me to relate to. I don't think we had a television and if we did, I don't recall watching it until late elementary. I did have books though. These were gifted to me as well. Except those that were purchased through the school book club, but that wasn't until later. However, I remember my Grandmother taking me to a bookstore in these early years and looking at all the Dr. Suess books. We choose one. She bought it for me and then later read it to me. There was no advertisement, and neither of us knew what the book would be about. We bought the \"The Butter Battle Book.\" Turns out this book is about the arms race, nuclear war, with a touch of WWII... I thought it was about toast at this age. These are all great memories for me and think that I was very fortunate to have such a loving, gifting, caring family. I am also fortunate that my family was industrious and created these things for me. I would imagine my experience would have been similar, given the same financial circumstances and family, even with today's current marketing. Reflection \u00b6 What is media literacy and why is it so important? After watching the videos and reading the articles how has your definition of media literacy changed since the beginning of the course? Media Literacy is the critical evaluation of the many aspects of media, including who published it and why they published it. Through analysis, it is possible to identify the intended audience and the meaning it may have intended to convey to them. We can also interpret, who wasn't included as audience and how the same message may be perceived by them. Understanding media helps to better understand and interpret the world we live in. At this early point in the course, I find the 5 Essential questions as a new stepping stone to helping students understand media. As for my understanding, I entered the course with some background understanding of Media Literacy, both personally and professionally. Share your thoughts about last weeks media deconstruction activity. Which questions are the hardest to answer and why? I think questions 3 & 4 from the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy are the most difficult and yet most helpful. How might different people interpret this message? Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? Both of these questions ask the viewer to step back from self and apply understanding from others' points of view. When removing self from the interpretation, the options of interpretation become endless - as people are complex beings. When removing self, we are also opening ourselves up to misidentify others' experiences and observations of the media - apply stereotypes or other falsehoods. So perhaps, question 3 is the most challenging because it is the vaguest and ambiguous. Which questions are the most helpful and why? As stated in the last question, the most difficult questions to answer are the most important. However, I now arrive at perhaps question 4 being most helpful. In that, when identifying the group being targeted (lifestyles, values, and points of view) it becomes easier to see who is missing. This may also lead to a greater understanding of how those not included may view the media, the most difficult question to answer. In Kellner and Share's Media Literacy is Not an Option, the authors state the following in their conclusion; Quote The task for educators and researchers is to engage in a new type of literacy education, from pre-school to higher education that incorporates new information communication technologies, media, and popular culture with critical pedagogy. This work must challenge dominant ideologies and empower youth to unveil the myths through creating their own alternative representations that empower their own voices and struggles for social justice. What do you think of this statement? Is it the job of educators to challenge dominant ideologies? What role should educators play, if any, in the institution of media literacy education? In 2021, this sounds like a loaded question. But, Yes, education should challenge the status quo - dominant idealogy. It is the role of education to expand students' knowledge, and this means building an understanding of multicultural experiences. Repeated throughout Keller & Share article was the idea of examining power, and empowering students to have a voice in their learning. To build Active Learning and Participatory Learning communities. As educators, how do you feel about Kellner and Share's following recommendation about the institution of media literacy education from pre-school to university? Quote We recommend that media education programs be instituted from preschool to university and that linking media literacy with production become a regular practice. Standards for media literacy programs should include criticizing the ways that media reproduce racism, sexism, homophobia, and other prejudices and encouraging students to find their own voices in critiquing media culture and producing alternative representations.\" Through my instructive experience utilizing the College & Career Readiness Standards (CCRS) - the highest level of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) - I recall having students understand, analyze, and interpret several points of view in a variety of media. We even produced various types of media, including infographics, advertisements, and other simple types of media. This naturally found its way into discussing racism, sexism, homophobia, and other prejudices, as the projects were based on Active Learning principles - creating a Participatory environment. As the instructor, I was also including media that intentionally exposed varying points of view. Having less experience in Elementary Education than I do with Middle & High School students, with the most experience in Adult Basic Education, I would be at a disadvantage to speak to what this might look like in younger students. I do think it is important for the discussion to take place and it would also be helpful for parents to engage in the conversations too. I would note, that Colorado adopted the CCSS in 2010, and the Kellner & Shares article was published in 2007 ( n.d., CDE ). After reading HOUSE BILL 21-1103 CONCERNING IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MEDIA LITERACY ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION what do you think it means for Colorado Students? Is it enough? Is it too much? Why or why not? What would you add or eliminate, if anything? I read it as an intentional act, to reinforce the Common Core State Standards. Kellner and Share stated, \"While media education is now expected to be taught since it is listed in almost all the state standards, unfortunately, little has been done to train teachers, provide resources or create curriculum\" (2008, p. 9.). I think Colorado's Bill is moving towards filling the professional learning gap in teacher education. With the other standards, Colorado has outlined resources and furthered those standards, to my knowledge. This bill is seeking to do the same for Media Literacy. Is it enough? It's a start... I think like all the standards parents also need to be involved, otherwise, we might hear phrases that sound like, \"and now we have these new media standards, what are they doing?\" Having parents and children involved might also help achieve the Participatory approach that Dewey envisioned a century ago, as well (Kellner & Share, 2008). What does the Feb 2020 Atlantic article describe as the \"sneaky ways\" advertisers are finding to reach kids other that TV ads? How is this different or the same from your childhood experience? I believe two distinct methods were described in the article. The first, creating media with the intent of selling merchandise aligned to it. The second, utilizing influencers to reach audiences. And as I have been reflecting, I can't help but wonder if reality television made way for the influencer phenomenon? My childhood experience is so far removed from this discussion, in that I do not recall having a television until late elementary school. This also includes seeing movies. While today's parents are putting media devices in their children's hands from birth onward...! I was very late to the smartphone revolution, so I am sure, many people's children were fully immersed in the technology before it even made it to my hands. I think that says a lot about the differences in how people can be raised. However, I would note, that I was learning to code the applications that run on the smartphone before owning one... and in late elementary school, I was learning basic coding on the early Macintosh in after-school programs. But in my earliest years, advertising media was nonexistent. When and how did advertisers reach you as a child? Are there other ways, not mentioned in the Atlantic article, that you have noticed in your own lives that advertisers gain access to children? As noted above, advertising was absent from my earliest years. Advertising didn't reach me until I took interest in activities that were in magazines. In thinking of ways advertisers reach children, did anyone mention product placement? I guess this is the form of media being created with the intent of selling merchandise - hello Disney - and just about every child actor coming out of their studios - Hannah Montana AKA Miley Cyrus, to name one of many. What about the many facets of reality television - American Idol? We may hit upon topics that may feel uncomfortable for some in this course. Discussion is not always easy but it is so important at times like these. This includes topics such as media portrayals of violence, opposing political agendas, sexual violence, discrimination and social injustices of all kinds. What can we do as fellow learners to ensure a civil environment for dialogue in this learning space? I think the keyword here is dialogue, the give and take of information. When entering into dialogue it is a two-way street of sharing ideas to build a new common ground of understanding. We are imperfect human beings, and as such we are neither right nor wrong, but building towards a greater understanding. Knowing this furthers the dialogue and builds awareness to new ideas; however, coming at someone with a pitchfork and an eraser is a sure way not to further dialogue. How are you doing? You don't have to answer this question directly in a public thread - you can simply know that as your instructor I am cognizant and aware that the closing few months have been a struggle for many. I will not lose sight of that in this course. Please reach out if there is anything I can do (or not do) that would make this experience better for you. Within reason, of course. We have learning to do, and that isn't always stress-free. I have been a graduate student and I commend your commitment to learning during an uneasy time. Thanks, I am doing well.","title":"Media and the Most Vulnerable Population"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-06-20-media-and-the-most-vulnerable-population/#media-deconstruction","text":"After completing your media journal assignment see if you can find a youtube video or image of the advertisement for that toy (or another toy) that you wanted as a child.

For example, the toys being targeted to me as a child in the 1970s had very different messaging due to the political and social expectations of the time. When you talk about the creator of the message, think about that company in the context of that moment in history. I'm submitting numerous images from a December 1988 magazine called BMX Plus! I remember having a subscription to this magazine and desiring just about anything from inside. I wanted a \"real\" bicycle, but we could not afford one. My bicycle at the time was my Uncle's old BMX bike, store brand. I later inherited my Father's store-brand mountain bike that he no longer rode. I later bought a used BMX bicycle at a Garage Sale, but it wasn't any manufacture featured in this magazine - so think huffy - noncompetitive. I wanted a bicycle I could ride in competitions. I was thinking about this magazine, and in its entirety could be considered one giant advertisement. Perhaps, similar to that of today's influencer. I say that because the magazine interviews professional riders, about the history, tips & tricks, and their gear. This connects the reader to personalities, but also products. For this deconstruction, I will critically look at the final image in the image list. BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Cover) BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Advertisment 1) BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Back) BMX Plus Magazine Dec 1988 Issue (Advertisment 2) Who created this message? This advertisement was created by the GT Bicycle Company. To quote, \"BMX was the foundation for the GT empire. It was our foray into bikes and drove the passion we are lucky enough to follow every day. The current GT BMX Lineup is designed to fuel your fire and get you stoked on going bigger, faster, and further\" ( GT Bicycles ). GT Bicycles were founded in 1972 and were a key player in spreading the BMX bicycle. Throughout the 80s, GT acquired several up-and-coming brands to form its empire; However in the 90s as interest in the sport declined the company was sold off and made public ( Wikipedia ). Which techniques are used to attract my attention? It's a full spread - filling two pages. This makes it impossible for the reader not to catch a glimpse of it. The ad also captures the aesthetic of the magazine with a large, stop motion, image mimicking the actual articles in the magazine. How might different people interpret this message? As a kid, I would see the images of the bicycles in the lower-left corner and desire them to be able to do the trick above. Parents may see the trick above and have mixed feelings about allowing their child to perform such a thing. Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? The entire magazine is targetting those who are interested in BMX. This advertisement is targetting a specific subsection of the sport and looks to be flatland or half-pipe riders. The gender is hidden behind the protective gear but could be assumed to be male, as they dominate the ads. Flipping through the magazine and viewing several articles and advertisements, the sport was included multiple genders, races, and ethnicity. The sport also extended beyond the U.S. territory, as seen in issues highlighting BMX worldwide. Why is this message being sent? This advertisement is being sent to endorse the GT Bicycle company. Often times the text not only highlights their product but also features a snippet about one of their sponsored riders. So advertisements would typically endorse the team and the products the team uses.","title":"Media Deconstruction"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-06-20-media-and-the-most-vulnerable-population/#media-use-journal","text":"This week I would like you to reflect upon your childhood and how adver!sers found you. What are the most memorable toys that you played with as a child? What do you remember most about those toys? This has been a challenging question for me this week, as I do not recall having much as a child growing up. I do remember that most of my toys were gifted to me through hand-me-downs or hand-made. My parents were young, even by today's standards. It wasn't until late elementary - 5th or 6th grade / 1989 or 1990 - that I recall shopping for toys. So early in my youth, I remember my mother sewing me \"Carebears\" made from patterns at the fabric store. I also remember my Grandmother making me a \"Cabbage Patch\" doll. Well, she made one for everyone in the family, but mine was special. My Grandfather made me several wooden gifts in his woodshop. One such gift was homemade lincoln logs. I remember I would stack and build structures from these and try new designs. There were no instructions or pictures included, so everything had to come from my imagination. I remember having a whole bunch of second-hand legos gifted to me. The legos were those of my three uncles' combined sets. These were brought to me in some sort of large container, again with no instructions or pictures. I had to build everything from my imagination. Today, this would look like that Lego TV show that challenges participants to build things, while kids watch. I also remember one of my Uncles gifting me his BMX bike. This gift may have sparked my interest in bicycles that I carry to this day. I remember riding it through the trailer park and behind the junkyard to some dirt track. There were other kids there. I suppose they were from the neighborhood. We moved often, so I didn't know anybody. I would've been early elementary, maybe 3rd or 4th grade? Anyway, I remember riding on that dirt track. Overcoming the fear of the steep hills and speeding around. I remember being encouraged by others that were there. That is memorable. I remember playing with all these things at different points of my childhood, as we moved from place to place. I never thought anything of them being gifted, hand-me-downs, or homemade. I don't ever remember having a desire for anything other than what I had. How did you get the toys? Were they gifts? Did someone buy them for you? If you know, where were they purchased? Do you have a memory of purchasing the toy? I remember shopping for \"Carebear\" fabric with my mother at a young age. I don't recall the television show at all, which came out in 1985. There were many patterns to choose from; we selected two or three Carebear patterns. I remember we choose by color and their symbols. We probably made up our meanings for the bears, seems like the thing we would have done. So no marketing influence my decision-making. I remember my Mother sewing them together for me and I helped stuff them. These Carebears joined me with my other stuffed animals that I had collected as gifts. I don't remember ever going to the store and buying any stuffed animals, and yet somehow I had like 50 of these things by late elementary school. They kept me company in my bed and bedroom right up to High School. I then passed them onto my new step-siblings, carrying the tradition forward. Everything else in my early elementary days where gifts. It wasn't until late elementary that I remember going to a store and buying toys, and that happened not frequently. I also remember receiving IOUs as gifts because we couldn't afford the toys at the store, yep. Do you remember any TV advertisements for the specific toys you are writing about? If not, was there some other reason behind your desire for the toy? Yeah... like I said in other discussions, this topic is really hard for me to relate to. I don't think we had a television and if we did, I don't recall watching it until late elementary. I did have books though. These were gifted to me as well. Except those that were purchased through the school book club, but that wasn't until later. However, I remember my Grandmother taking me to a bookstore in these early years and looking at all the Dr. Suess books. We choose one. She bought it for me and then later read it to me. There was no advertisement, and neither of us knew what the book would be about. We bought the \"The Butter Battle Book.\" Turns out this book is about the arms race, nuclear war, with a touch of WWII... I thought it was about toast at this age. These are all great memories for me and think that I was very fortunate to have such a loving, gifting, caring family. I am also fortunate that my family was industrious and created these things for me. I would imagine my experience would have been similar, given the same financial circumstances and family, even with today's current marketing.","title":"Media Use Journal"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-06-20-media-and-the-most-vulnerable-population/#reflection","text":"What is media literacy and why is it so important? After watching the videos and reading the articles how has your definition of media literacy changed since the beginning of the course? Media Literacy is the critical evaluation of the many aspects of media, including who published it and why they published it. Through analysis, it is possible to identify the intended audience and the meaning it may have intended to convey to them. We can also interpret, who wasn't included as audience and how the same message may be perceived by them. Understanding media helps to better understand and interpret the world we live in. At this early point in the course, I find the 5 Essential questions as a new stepping stone to helping students understand media. As for my understanding, I entered the course with some background understanding of Media Literacy, both personally and professionally. Share your thoughts about last weeks media deconstruction activity. Which questions are the hardest to answer and why? I think questions 3 & 4 from the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy are the most difficult and yet most helpful. How might different people interpret this message? Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? Both of these questions ask the viewer to step back from self and apply understanding from others' points of view. When removing self from the interpretation, the options of interpretation become endless - as people are complex beings. When removing self, we are also opening ourselves up to misidentify others' experiences and observations of the media - apply stereotypes or other falsehoods. So perhaps, question 3 is the most challenging because it is the vaguest and ambiguous. Which questions are the most helpful and why? As stated in the last question, the most difficult questions to answer are the most important. However, I now arrive at perhaps question 4 being most helpful. In that, when identifying the group being targeted (lifestyles, values, and points of view) it becomes easier to see who is missing. This may also lead to a greater understanding of how those not included may view the media, the most difficult question to answer. In Kellner and Share's Media Literacy is Not an Option, the authors state the following in their conclusion; Quote The task for educators and researchers is to engage in a new type of literacy education, from pre-school to higher education that incorporates new information communication technologies, media, and popular culture with critical pedagogy. This work must challenge dominant ideologies and empower youth to unveil the myths through creating their own alternative representations that empower their own voices and struggles for social justice. What do you think of this statement? Is it the job of educators to challenge dominant ideologies? What role should educators play, if any, in the institution of media literacy education? In 2021, this sounds like a loaded question. But, Yes, education should challenge the status quo - dominant idealogy. It is the role of education to expand students' knowledge, and this means building an understanding of multicultural experiences. Repeated throughout Keller & Share article was the idea of examining power, and empowering students to have a voice in their learning. To build Active Learning and Participatory Learning communities. As educators, how do you feel about Kellner and Share's following recommendation about the institution of media literacy education from pre-school to university? Quote We recommend that media education programs be instituted from preschool to university and that linking media literacy with production become a regular practice. Standards for media literacy programs should include criticizing the ways that media reproduce racism, sexism, homophobia, and other prejudices and encouraging students to find their own voices in critiquing media culture and producing alternative representations.\" Through my instructive experience utilizing the College & Career Readiness Standards (CCRS) - the highest level of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) - I recall having students understand, analyze, and interpret several points of view in a variety of media. We even produced various types of media, including infographics, advertisements, and other simple types of media. This naturally found its way into discussing racism, sexism, homophobia, and other prejudices, as the projects were based on Active Learning principles - creating a Participatory environment. As the instructor, I was also including media that intentionally exposed varying points of view. Having less experience in Elementary Education than I do with Middle & High School students, with the most experience in Adult Basic Education, I would be at a disadvantage to speak to what this might look like in younger students. I do think it is important for the discussion to take place and it would also be helpful for parents to engage in the conversations too. I would note, that Colorado adopted the CCSS in 2010, and the Kellner & Shares article was published in 2007 ( n.d., CDE ). After reading HOUSE BILL 21-1103 CONCERNING IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MEDIA LITERACY ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION what do you think it means for Colorado Students? Is it enough? Is it too much? Why or why not? What would you add or eliminate, if anything? I read it as an intentional act, to reinforce the Common Core State Standards. Kellner and Share stated, \"While media education is now expected to be taught since it is listed in almost all the state standards, unfortunately, little has been done to train teachers, provide resources or create curriculum\" (2008, p. 9.). I think Colorado's Bill is moving towards filling the professional learning gap in teacher education. With the other standards, Colorado has outlined resources and furthered those standards, to my knowledge. This bill is seeking to do the same for Media Literacy. Is it enough? It's a start... I think like all the standards parents also need to be involved, otherwise, we might hear phrases that sound like, \"and now we have these new media standards, what are they doing?\" Having parents and children involved might also help achieve the Participatory approach that Dewey envisioned a century ago, as well (Kellner & Share, 2008). What does the Feb 2020 Atlantic article describe as the \"sneaky ways\" advertisers are finding to reach kids other that TV ads? How is this different or the same from your childhood experience? I believe two distinct methods were described in the article. The first, creating media with the intent of selling merchandise aligned to it. The second, utilizing influencers to reach audiences. And as I have been reflecting, I can't help but wonder if reality television made way for the influencer phenomenon? My childhood experience is so far removed from this discussion, in that I do not recall having a television until late elementary school. This also includes seeing movies. While today's parents are putting media devices in their children's hands from birth onward...! I was very late to the smartphone revolution, so I am sure, many people's children were fully immersed in the technology before it even made it to my hands. I think that says a lot about the differences in how people can be raised. However, I would note, that I was learning to code the applications that run on the smartphone before owning one... and in late elementary school, I was learning basic coding on the early Macintosh in after-school programs. But in my earliest years, advertising media was nonexistent. When and how did advertisers reach you as a child? Are there other ways, not mentioned in the Atlantic article, that you have noticed in your own lives that advertisers gain access to children? As noted above, advertising was absent from my earliest years. Advertising didn't reach me until I took interest in activities that were in magazines. In thinking of ways advertisers reach children, did anyone mention product placement? I guess this is the form of media being created with the intent of selling merchandise - hello Disney - and just about every child actor coming out of their studios - Hannah Montana AKA Miley Cyrus, to name one of many. What about the many facets of reality television - American Idol? We may hit upon topics that may feel uncomfortable for some in this course. Discussion is not always easy but it is so important at times like these. This includes topics such as media portrayals of violence, opposing political agendas, sexual violence, discrimination and social injustices of all kinds. What can we do as fellow learners to ensure a civil environment for dialogue in this learning space? I think the keyword here is dialogue, the give and take of information. When entering into dialogue it is a two-way street of sharing ideas to build a new common ground of understanding. We are imperfect human beings, and as such we are neither right nor wrong, but building towards a greater understanding. Knowing this furthers the dialogue and builds awareness to new ideas; however, coming at someone with a pitchfork and an eraser is a sure way not to further dialogue. How are you doing? You don't have to answer this question directly in a public thread - you can simply know that as your instructor I am cognizant and aware that the closing few months have been a struggle for many. I will not lose sight of that in this course. Please reach out if there is anything I can do (or not do) that would make this experience better for you. Within reason, of course. We have learning to do, and that isn't always stress-free. I have been a graduate student and I commend your commitment to learning during an uneasy time. Thanks, I am doing well.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-06-27-gender-in-the-media/","text":"Media Deconstruction \u00b6 Numerous popular songs have explored what it means to be masculine or feminine in our culture. Find a song, yourself, that you feel does a good job exploring masculine and feminine themes and explain what you think the song is saying. Be sure to submit the lyrics of the song and a link to a video (if you can find one) along with a brief (a few sentences per question is fine) analysis of the song using the 5 Key Questions as your guide. Try to draw on relevant points from Killing Us Softly 4 (TedEd) to support and illustrate your deconstruction and interpretation of the song. I selected this song primarily for the video because the video captures some of Jeanne Kilburn's criticisms of media driven gender expressions ( Wikipedia ). The lyrics break down the idea that gender expressions in the binary of masculinity and femininity box people in, and at the end of the day we want to be free. Additionally, the distribution of the song further shows the nuances of today\u2019s advertising and was likely emerging at the time of the documentary. I will attempt to peel back the many layers in this new media of advertising. Montana Tucker - Be Myself ft. Todrick Hall \u00b6 \"Be Myself\" Times Square Flashmob! \u00b6 Who created this message? Montana Tucker ft. Todrick Hall. According to healthyceleb.com , Montana Tucker began her career as a model at 8 years old. In Kilburn\u2019s critique, this would have been attributed to advertising effects. Montana Tucker is a singer, dancer, actress, model, social media personality, and YouTuber. Todrick Hall is managed by Scooter Braun who is the person behind Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepson. Hall is known for video-driven projects, more than music, and has been seen in commercials for Fiat, MTV, and McDonald's, according to healthyceleb.com . Additionally, in the YouTube description, there is a long list of people involved in the creation of this media. Which techniques are used to attract my attention? This is a pop song with a positive message and the majority of the video is shot in a storytelling manner. In fact, it is broken into two separate stories showing two different childhood tales of growing up. If the upbeat song doesn\u2019t catch you, then maybe watching the story unfold might. Additionally, the lyrics and video incorporate a choreographed dance to accompany the song. How might different people interpret this message? The song carries a strong LGBTQ+ Pride message, just look into the comment section. The song also addresses bullying and other negative behaviors that have been instilled through negative interpretations of femininity and masculinity. As Kilburn pointed out, advertising has placed emphasis on marketing a certain look and behavior for different genders. Those who don\u2019t meet those expectations may build deep personal trauma from how others view them, also noted by Kilborn. In this case, the video goes a step further, than print media, and shows shaming and aggression as a result of this dominance and oppressive behavior. Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? This song is for the marginalized members of the community who have been forced to feel it is not acceptable to be themselves. I have included a second video of a Flash Mob gathering in Times Square to celebrate the identities and expressions that the song evokes. It is inclusive of multiple body images, genders, expressions, races, and ethnicities. Why is this message being sent? The messaging likely is serving multiple purposes. First, Tucker\u2019s and Hall\u2019s message is about empowerment and breaking free from the stigma of social expectations, including masculine and feminine expressions. The second is a bit cloudier, as Tucker endorses products on social media. So this could also be tied to building a self-brand and bringing more advertisers in. \u201cMontana Tucker has done endorsement work for a number of popular brands which include the likes of Ovaltine, Sketchers, BMW, and Wendys. She has also either endorsed or promoted a variety of brands through social media which include the likes of DIOSA by Seco, Dolls Kill, FILA, ADINA\u2019S JEWELS, BFYNE, GO GET GLITTER, SugarBearHair, White Fox, REVOLVE, Harley-Davidson, Forever21, H&M, Moschino, Bumble, and good hYOUman\u201d (n.d., [healthyceleb.com)(https://healthyceleb.com/montana-tucker/)]. Third, this song features Todrick Hall and is closely connected in developing the empowerment message. Speculation, they may be building a future for more collaboration or supporting each other's artistic careers. Fourth, this song is gaining traction as a number of YouTube Zumba videos are appearing. This is due to the integration of a choreographed dance (in the video and lyrics), further promoting the song's message and branding.

Describe the clothes worn and roles played by the thin women versus the non-thin women. After you have completed this step write a reflection in your journal based on the following prompts; What did you notice about the differences between how thin women were portrayed on television versus the way non-thin women were portrayed? Do you think these portrayals have the power to shape how young girls and women see themselves and others? How so? How about the way that young boys and men see girls and women? Eating disorder specialists cite the influence of the media as one influential factor in the development of eating disorders among young women. In what ways do you think the media supports eating-disordered attitudes and behaviors? Next Count and record examples of times when a young woman, or girl, is sexualized in an advertisement. After you have completed this step write a reflection in your journal based on the following prompts; What message does this image send to young girls about sex? What message does this image send to young boys about sex? What do you think it says to older men? For this week's media use journal, I disabled ad blockers and watched about 2 hours of a YouTube Channel. I recorded the entry and exit of videos with any advertisements in between. The YouTube channel I opened happened to be primarily Live music sessions, while those that weren't live sessions used ambient visualized videography. Fort his journal entry, I will be focusing on the ads since the channel was live performances. The following is a timecoded playlist 00:00 R\u00f6yksopp & Robyn \"Monument\" 00:47 Christian L\u00f6ffler & Ensemble 01:02 Popup Ad: Outer Sofa 01:32 Full Ad: Grammarly 02:20 Full Ad: UC Health 02:57 Fkj & Masego - Tadow 03:22 Full Ad: Amazon 03:52 Full Ad: Geico 04:17 Full Ad: Emgality 04:48 Full Ad: AXS 05:27 Agnes Obel - The Curse 06:02 Full Ad: Infinity 06:22 Full Ad: Xfinity 06:42 Kid Francescoli - Moon 07:02 KEKP Icelandic Airwaves - Gus Gus 07:12 Popup ad: Joe Bonamassa 07:37 Full Ad: UC Health 08:12 Full Ad: Visit California 09:12 n u a g e s - Dreams 09:27 Popup Ad: Collibra 10:02 Full Ad: Grammarly 10:37 Full Ad: Mini 10:57 Klangarussell - Circuits 11:27 Full Ad: Mastercard 11:52 Foals - Late Night 12:17 Full Ad: Geico 12:37 Full Ad: Jaguar 13:00 London Grammar - Wasting My Young Years Question 1 \u00b6 As far I saw in the channel and ads women were portrayed as middle class (dress), in roles as students, professionals, singles, couples, parents, and grandparents. The body types for most roles I would consider healthy, with grandparents moving towards overweight. The one exception would be Infinity, selling the idea of \"luxury\" and moving to the upper class. Question on reflection In the ads, women were portrayed in a variety of roles but I would consider them targetting the middle class. I would describe the women and men in the ads as healthy weight, with grandparents being portrayed on the heavier to obese side. In a side conversation about weight in the media, I wandered into the fashion industry and had meaningful full conversations about the changing industry. However, change is slow and some fashion brands are struggling to break out of the thin model paradigm. This industry was noted by France's ministry of health as contributing to eating disorders. A friend also chimed in and shared how when they were a model 25 years ago, they weighed about 35 pounds under their healthy weight and were considered the \"right\" weight. This created many health conditions at the time and are still uncomfortable with healthy body weight. We also discussed how the majority of Americans are considered obese and how fashion sizes are getting larger to accommodate this... what was a medium is now small. Maybe this has to do with fast food and advertising, showing healthy people eating unhealthy food? France bans extremely thin models (2017, BBC) This article points to France's efforts to try to eliminate the \"thin model\" expectation from continuing. As well as labeling of Photoshopped images. \"The health ministry says the aim is to fight eating disorders and inaccessible ideals of beauty.\" The article notes France joins Italy, Spain, and Israel. Skeletal models including Kaia Gerber storm YSL runaway despite fashion giant\u2019s vow to end use of painfully thin women (2019, The Sun) This article discusses despite efforts and brands supporting the idea of eliminating the thin model tradition they are having a difficult time breaking from this tradition, specifically Yves Saint Laurent. Question 2 \u00b6 I did not see any sexualization of women in the ads that I viewed. Question on reflection Ads that contained women showed them in a variety of ways: single, in relationships, in families. I would consider them connecting with the emotion of happiness. In the MasterCard ad, they included LGBT relationships, the only advertiser to do this that I saw. Visit California showed an independent single woman on an adventure in California. From the ads I viewed, I see a shift in advertising from that in the past. Reflection \u00b6 Reflect upon the personal care and beauty products you use on a regular basis. What makes the advertisement for these items stay in your memory? Do you think advertising influences the kinds of products you buy? If yes, how? If no, explain why you think you\u2019re able to resist it. I am not a brand loyalist and find new products primarily on the shelves at marketplaces that I support. Some marketplaces vet the products before selling, checking product ingredients, environmental impacts, labor, and other ethical concerns. I gain insight into some products through product reviews - that I search out - and others through product recommendations. I approach both of these with an eye of skepticism, especially user reviews. Mostly I find new products without advertisements and will trial products because they are there. If I like the product, I will continue buying it. One example would be Chandrika Ayurvedic Soap . I picked up the soap originally because it was the cheapest at $1.00 and natural. I do not resist advertisements, I just am not exposed to or heavily influenced by advertisements. My only mode of consuming media is online or print. While online, I use a VPN and a Browser-based content blocker. Together, these eliminate all advertising from sight, even on advertising-based services, i.e. Google, YouTube, etc. What are some common stereotypes about feminists and feminism? Where do you think these stereotypes come from? What terms are often used for those who voice strong opinions? How might these terms serve to keep people from voicing their opinions? For starters, who's common stereotypes are we considering; are we looking at the dominant White culture feminists, Latinx feminists, Black Trans feminists, female nonfeminists, or dominant media portrayal of feminism? Stereotypes will vary amongst different groups of people, time periods, and are an illogical fallacy - a misinformed social construct. The only way to answer this question is from my point of view; otherwise, I would be making a false assumption of another's viewpoint on feminism and feminists. Stereotypes emerge from systems of power and those seeking to maintain power, privilege, and social location. They may arise within any group. Those being oppressed may also develop stereotypes of their oppressors. Stereotypes emerge as broad generalizations based solely on perceived differences or perceived behaviors. Some terms used to describe those who voice strong opinions: Bitch, Dick, Leadership, Bossy, Creative, Defiant, Pushy, Obstinant, Threatening, Intimidating, Decisive, Intense, and many more... Term usage may change among groups and may be applied differently within specific communities, gender identities, sexual orientations, race, ethnicities, etc... All the above comes down to holding on to power. Consider and describe other social movements where people were labeled in ways that deflected attention away from the actual issues being addressed. Wikipedia COINTELPRO (syllabic abbreviation derived from Counter Intelligence Program) (1956\u20131971) was a series of covert and illegal projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic American political machines. Some groups targeted by the government operation included: Feminist Movement Anti-Vietnam War Civil Rights Movement Black Power Movement American Indian Movement Environmental and Animal Rights groups The project was carried out through numerous tactics including perjury, witness tampering & intimidation, withholding of evidence, and more. The aim of the operation was to \"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise, neutralize\" activities carried out by the organizations (n.d., COINTELPRO Revisited ). Methods used to fulfill the aim included: Infiltration, Psychological warfare, Harassment via the legal system, Illegal force, and undermining public opinion (n.d., Wikipedia ). The tactics aims and methods used by COINTELPRO are still alive and well, and have defined a playbook to disrupt current political movements and activism. One such group under disruption would be Black Lives Matter. Known FBI assessments of the organization are built and based upon anti-Black racial stereotypes (2019, ACLU ). In today's media landscape, misinformation runs rampant and serves only one purpose, to undermine public opinion (2021, NPR ). What are some typical expectations of femininity in our culture?

I approach both of these with an eye of skepticism, especially user reviews. Mostly I find new products without advertisements and will trial products because they are there.

Where do you think these stereotypes come from? What terms are often used for those who voice strong opinions? How might these terms serve to keep people from voicing their opinions? For starters, who's common stereotypes are we considering; are we looking at the dominant White culture feminists, Latinx feminists, Black Trans feminists, female nonfeminists, or dominant media portrayal of feminism? Stereotypes will vary amongst different groups of people, time periods, and are an illogical fallacy - a misinformed social construct. The only way to answer this question is from my point of view; otherwise, I would be making a false assumption of another's viewpoint on feminism and feminists. Stereotypes emerge from systems of power and those seeking to maintain power, privilege, and social location. They may arise within any group. Those being oppressed may also develop stereotypes of their oppressors. Stereotypes emerge as broad generalizations based solely on perceived differences or perceived behaviors. Some terms used to describe those who voice strong opinions: Bitch, Dick, Leadership, Bossy, Creative, Defiant, Pushy, Obstinant, Threatening, Intimidating, Decisive, Intense, and many more... Term usage may change among groups and may be applied differently within specific communities, gender identities, sexual orientations, race, ethnicities, etc... All the above comes down to holding on to power. Consider and describe other social movements where people were labeled in ways that deflected attention away from the actual issues being addressed. Wikipedia COINTELPRO (syllabic abbreviation derived from Counter Intelligence Program) (1956\u20131971) was a series of covert and illegal projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting domestic American political machines. Some groups targeted by the government operation included: Feminist Movement Anti-Vietnam War Civil Rights Movement Black Power Movement American Indian Movement Environmental and Animal Rights groups The project was carried out through numerous tactics including perjury, witness tampering & intimidation, withholding of evidence, and more. The aim of the operation was to \"expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise, neutralize\" activities carried out by the organizations (n.d., COINTELPRO Revisited ). Methods used to fulfill the aim included: Infiltration, Psychological warfare, Harassment via the legal system, Illegal force, and undermining public opinion (n.d., Wikipedia ). The tactics aims and methods used by COINTELPRO are still alive and well, and have defined a playbook to disrupt current political movements and activism. One such group under disruption would be Black Lives Matter. Known FBI assessments of the organization are built and based upon anti-Black racial stereotypes (2019, ACLU ).

Synopsis \u00b6 Keef Knight is a black cartoonist living a life that is aware of racial inequities but held a naive belief \"that it just wouldn't happen to him.\" The first 10 minutes of the episode show Keef moving through life, encountering many forms of unconscious bias. This comes to a head while hanging a flyer for an upcoming comic book release. Keef is knocked to the ground by police and arrested at gunpoint for matching a mugger's profile, a six-foot black male. This trauma awakens and challenges Keef to fully acknowledge and choices surrounding the racial disparities he lives with daily. Who created this message? Woke is an American comedy television series co-created by Keith Knight and Marshall Todd and starring Lamorne Morris. The series premiered on Hulu on September 9, 2020. On November 17, 2020, Hulu renewed the series for a second season (Wikipedia). Which techniques are used to attract my attention? A colorful modern episode poster draws viewers into the TV-Series. The show is also labeled as a comedy, so those liking comedies might be enticed to watch. From Hulu TVMA \u2022 Comedy \u2022 Animation \u2022 Black Stories \u2022 TV Series \u2022 2020 Inspired by the life and work of artist Keith Knight, the comedy series WOKE takes an absurdly irreverent look at identity and culture as it follows Keef, an African-American cartoonist finally on the verge of mainstream success when an unexpected incident changes everything. With a fresh outlook on the world around him, Keef must now navigate the new voices and ideas that confront and challenge him, all without setting aflame everything he\u2019s already built. How might different people interpret this message? Reviewing the comments thread on IMDB reveals the target audience is up for question. If the intended audience is those unfamiliar with the issues addressed in the first episode, then it is heavy-handed, biased, and out of touch with reality. Then a split happens amongst those familiar with the topics. It either saddens viewers or meets them with a sense of agreement with the issues. As I was rewatching Season 1, Episode 1, I felt the \"text\" of the message was not hidden and was presented on the surface level; such as these are the issues. Some issues raised: Unconscious bias (02:21) In a conversation on public transit about Keef's comic strip, a passengers states, \"You know, it's funny, I didn't think you'd be... tall.\" It was implied the passenger wanted to say black. Police brutality (08:52) While Keef is hanging a bill for an upcoming comic convention, the SFPD knock his headphones off at gunpoint, force Keef to the ground, arrest him, then release him (no apology) for mistaken identity (6-foot black male). I find this very relatable as I was falsely arrested in my home while sleeping because the police arrived at the wrong address! Social inequities (09:13) One of many, but while Keef is being falsely arrested at gunpoint, his white friend, Gunther, runs up to the police yelling, and poking at the SFPD, with zero consequence. Stereotypes (10:24, 15:52, 18:36, 28:33... ) Following the assault incurred by the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), Keef enters into a PTSD-induced state. He sees and hears inanimate objects (40oz of beer, trashcans, a pen) talking to him in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). This occurs throughout the episode(s). Many more stereotypes are layered into each character, including false identities placed on Keef's friend Clovis. Keef later states this during a mental breakdown, \"Just because my friend is African-American and wears Jordans does not make him a pro-athlete.\" We then see Clovis's date stand up and leave. Whitewashing (1:06, 12:23) Begining early in a meeting with white advertising executives, and later picks up during the syndication of Keef's comic book. When looking through the marketing materials, Keef notices his image for the book jacket and speaking tour had been lightened. Keef says, \"Am I too black for my own comic book?\" The ad executives stumble on the question and bring up a 95% \"cross-over\" index, referring to white relatedness. The first executive says, \"We don't see color...\" while the second executive says, \"No one's gonna ever accuse you of being too black, okay...\" followed by, \"Racial stuff, huh?\" in an uncomfortable tone. Gentrification & Appropriation (13:55) After the ad exec meeting Keef is looking for comfort and heads to a friend... Darnells' Barbershop. When arriving Keef enters finds the shop remains the same but Darnell has been replaced by white-bearded hipsters. The shopkeeper explains how they kept all aspects of black culture, Ebony & Jet magazines, memorabilia, Hennessy, and even the name, but got rid of Darnell. That's a lot to raise in the first episode, and there are probably more, and why it has such varied reviews in the threads. The episode is showing lived experiences of some and is not relatable to all or even uncomfortable for those who have lived similar experiences. The opening Headline of the episode states: \"Inspired by one experience... shared by many.\" The subtext of the message was challenging assumptions. The main character, Keef Knight, does not conform to media stereotypes of a black male. Other characters also blend and defy media stereotypes. The sets are intentionally set, with what seems to be the ever-present dominant white cultural influences that Keef lives in. The soundtrack represented several musical styles, filling the moods of the script. Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? Many lifestyles are represented in the episode, it is not singularly focused. The setting is urban. The main character, Keef Knight, is portrayed as a successful black cartoonist in their 30s. Other characters include a successful \"hustler\", a \"hippy\" entrepreneur, a \"BLM\" activist, community organizers, advertising executives, the list can continue. It's a creative take on raising/challenging systemic issues. Early on (3:25), Keef Knight has a conversation in a comic book store where a fan explains how they really like how Keef's comics talk about race and color in America. Keef's response is, \"Wow, that's the first time I heard that one.\" In a sense getting at the heart of Media Literacy and Media Deconstruction - a message is perceived differently by different viewers. Later in the episode (21:00), Keef is talking with friends and they are discussing the idea of \"woke.\" As they break things down, Keef says, \"I know this type of stuff happens all the time and I know this is gonna sound fucked up, but I just didn't think it would happen to me.\" Conversation then diverges into two points of view, what to do? Should Keef set it aside and continue living a successful life, allowing these newly realized inequalities to dominate and conform as usual; or should Keef speak up about the injustices felt. Both views will land on the viewing audience's ears differently and could be viewed in a positive light or negative light. Hence, America's current conversation. SPOILERS: More viewpoints are incorporated in later episodes, including the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). This early interaction drives the storyline, as well as legal inequalities. Why is this message being sent? This message is being sent to directly raise the systemic issues in America, created before the events of 2020. Lamorne says, \"You can't change something unless you're faced with it\". The whole series is based in experiences of black, indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC), and this point of view will seem foreign or inaccurate to those who have not experienced or choose not to validate these experiences. Trever Noah explains, \"one of the major experiences of being a Black person is that even when you choose not to engage in the conversation around how Black people are treated, at some point you will be treated like a Black person... And at some point, the very Black nature of your skin means you are involved in something that you didn't choose to be involved in.\" Summarizing the base storyline of \"Woke\".

For Week 4, Critical Analysis, I will be looking at the article \" I\u2019m a black activist. Here\u2019s what people get wrong about Black Lives Matter ,\" by Vann R. Newkirk II and published to Vox Media in December 8, 2015. It looks like the author of the article is no longer with Vox Media, as their author page is missing. Curiosity drove me to do a quick search and found they are currently writing for The Atlantic, a multi-platform publisher providing \"analysis of breaking news, politics, international affairs, education, technology, health science, and culture\" ( Wikipedia ). Wikipedia also holds a biography for the author of this piece: Vann R. Newkirk II (born December 27, 1988) is an American journalist and staff writer for The Atlantic who writes on politics, the environment, race, and healthcare policy ( Wikipedia ). Reading through Newkirk's career, a reader may gain additional insights about the author, providing a base for the reflective nature of the Vox Media article. Yes, this article is based on the writer's anecdotes from lived experience. The article begins in the author's past, reflecting on guest speakers in their college years. This is a starting point to draw the point of the article, how do people pick where the Civil Rights Movement left off? Being familiar with the Civil Rights Movement, I didn't need to do much background research. A reader with limited knowledge of these events may find the piece easy to digest, as it is written in a reflective story mode. Newkirk frames the message around two guest speakers at the college, both of who had historically different roles during the Civil Rights Movement. The first, Andrew Young, took a more conservative approach during the movement and it was reflected in the speech they gave at the college. Newkirk makes the point that Young encouraged marginalized groups to adopt the mainstream values or to quote, \"Young taught us we had to become less hip-hop in our speech and dress; he told us to scrub the \"ain'ts\" and \"finnas\" from our public language. We had to work twice as hard as white folks to get their sympathy \u2014 that was the torch Young passed to my class.\" Newkirk then reflects on Julian Bond, a speaker that followed the next week. This is done intentionally to draw parallels to today's climate around protest - is there a right way? Newkirk draws connections and begins by comparing the two activists, Young to Bond. These two activists had many things in common; however Bond took a different approach during the Civil Rights Movement and we hear this through the author's reflection. Newkirk recalls Bond's words, \"We would have to adapt and innovate for the times. Maybe we would have to let go of some of the respectability, he said.\" There is a stark difference between the first and the last speaker introduced in the article and Newkirk draws the same conclusion, \"Forty years later, two of its luminaries stood before my college class and delivered opposing takes on its legacy. How did these differences play out in the history of the civil rights movement? Who was right?\" However, it is this conclusion that brings the article to current times. In essence, creating part II of the article. It is here, that Newkirk opens the door for the reader to pause and consider the closing questions before moving forward. Which speaker do your political protests beliefs more align with? Moving forward into part II of the article, Newkirk begins to paint a picture of the modern Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement through comparison to the past and specifically references the speakers introduced in part I. This ties to the past where Newkirk is attempting to inform the reader about the \"what people get wrong\" about BLM. However, a new character is introduced. A critic of Black Lives Matter, \"Barbara Reynolds, a prominent black journalist, civil rights movement activist, and biographer of Jesse Jackson Sr.\" Newkirk is setting aside the politics to talk about people, and people have differing views, even within a movement. Comparisons are drawn, and generational points of view are introduced; however, Newkirk stays on the point of continuing to ask, which way is right? Moving to part III of the article it shifts again to focus on two groups from the Civil Rights era. Continuing the train of thought, groups are working towards the same goal but with two very different approaches. Newkirk references Reynold's point of view several times throughout this section, questioning their position, as Reynolds is painted to stand behind the textbook image of the Civil Rights Movement, or that of Young. Reynold's is labeled as an \"old way\" of thinking. However, Newkirk isn't necessarily advocating for a different position here, but rather refocusing on the question, which way of protest is right? The \"old way\" is in quotes because at this point Newkirk has shown there were multiple \"ways\" of protesting during the Civil Rights Movement and then points to the present day. Those continuing to protest injustices have learned from the past, just as those of the past did. And this is highlighted in part IV, where Newkirk continues towards the conclusion of the article by painting a picture of how BLM has picked up pieces from the past and brought them to modern society. In the end, Newkirk reframes the idea of which way is better and leads to the idea that BLM is an evolution of ideas. They did this through storytelling, referencing generational points of view, and citing historical people, events, and speakers. First, introduce the reader to speakers at their college with differing views of how to be active in the Civil Rights Movement. Then moving to a generational perspective of the then and now. Newkirk then connects the reader to two specific groups during the Civil Rights Movement and draws parallels to the BLM. Newkirk questions the generation's point of view, that the \"old way\" is the right way of protesting, but does this through the lens of what was the old way? The article was carefully constructed to show the reader that there wasn't just one way to protest during the Civil Rights Movement and concludes that BLM has embraced this idea through examples.","title":"Examining Portrayals of Race in the Media"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-06-examining-portrayals-of-race-in-the-media/#media-deconstruction","text":"Find any media message, a printed message, a news episode, a television show, an image of a protest sign, a billboard, a speech, a song, a book... literally ANY public message that is out in the world that you feel is commen!ng on, or making a statement about, or has to do, in any way, with race and our current moment.

Which speaker do your political protests beliefs more align with? Moving forward into part II of the article, Newkirk begins to paint a picture of the modern Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement through comparison to the past and specifically references the speakers introduced in part I. This ties to the past where Newkirk is attempting to inform the reader about the \"what people get wrong\" about BLM. However, a new character is introduced. A critic of Black Lives Matter, \"Barbara Reynolds, a prominent black journalist, civil rights movement activist, and biographer of Jesse Jackson Sr.\" Newkirk is setting aside the politics to talk about people, and people have differing views, even within a movement. Comparisons are drawn, and generational points of view are introduced; however, Newkirk stays on the point of continuing to ask, which way is right? Moving to part III of the article it shifts again to focus on two groups from the Civil Rights era. Continuing the train of thought, groups are working towards the same goal but with two very different approaches. Newkirk references Reynold's point of view several times throughout this section, questioning their position, as Reynolds is painted to stand behind the textbook image of the Civil Rights Movement, or that of Young. Reynold's is labeled as an \"old way\" of thinking. However, Newkirk isn't necessarily advocating for a different position here, but rather refocusing on the question, which way of protest is right? The \"old way\" is in quotes because at this point Newkirk has shown there were multiple \"ways\" of protesting during the Civil Rights Movement and then points to the present day. Those continuing to protest injustices have learned from the past, just as those of the past did. And this is highlighted in part IV, where Newkirk continues towards the conclusion of the article by painting a picture of how BLM has picked up pieces from the past and brought them to modern society. In the end, Newkirk reframes the idea of which way is better and leads to the idea that BLM is an evolution of ideas. They did this through storytelling, referencing generational points of view, and citing historical people, events, and speakers. First, introduce the reader to speakers at their college with differing views of how to be active in the Civil Rights Movement. Then moving to a generational perspective of the then and now. Newkirk then connects the reader to two specific groups during the Civil Rights Movement and draws parallels to the BLM. Newkirk questions the generation's point of view, that the \"old way\" is the right way of protesting, but does this through the lens of what was the old way? The article was carefully constructed to show the reader that there wasn't just one way to protest during the Civil Rights Movement and concludes that BLM has embraced this idea through examples.","title":"Critical Analysis"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-11-the-mean-world-syndrome-media-violence-and-the-cultivation-of-fear/","text":"Media Deconstruction \u00b6 Like last week, you will use the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy to deconstruct the ads and clips below. In addition to the 5 Key questions, I have developed a Media Artifact Interrogation and Analysis Framework to assist teachers and students expand their analysis of critical media literacy to include how media messages address global/historical focus, race, culture, violence, power, and happiness. These questions are designed to supplement the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy to inspire sociopolitical development and action. As you are looking at the examples in this Media Deconstruction Exercise use the five key questions and consider the media artifact in terms of these supplemental questions. You do not have to answer all of the questions for each artifact - just the ones that stand out to you like the most pertinent. Hamilton | Official Trailer | Disney+ \u00b6 Who created this message? I would imagine the Disney+ marketing team created the message. Which techniques are used to attract my attention? Typical Disney intro, and movie theatrics, heavy base, and leading soundtrack. Large titles bring excitement to the live action of the trailer. How might different people interpret this message? I mean, I'm confused by it. Is it a recording of the Broadway show or a recreation? But those familiar and those who are fans of \"Hamilton\" will meet it with anticipation. Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? I'm not sure, this Broadway show received a lot of press about being a hip-hop historical adventure? Are we critiquing the Broadway show, Disney interpretation of that (are they the same), or the movie trailer? Why is this message being sent? This message is advertising for a movie showing on Disney+. It is intended to inform or recruit subscribers to the service. Hop - TV Spot: \"In Common\" \u00b6 Who created this message? From the YouTube page, \"The film is helmed by Tim Hill, director of the blockbuster Alvin and the Chipmunks and produced by Chris Meledandri's Illumination Entertainment (Despicable Me).\" So I would imagine the film studio put it together for marketing the film to families - as it looks to be a family film. Which techniques are used to attract my attention? I would consider this a typical movie trailer, with the film studio upfront and that deep-voiced narration of the movie. The studio pulled out select sense and collaged them together to make the movie seem lighthearted and funny. How might different people interpret this message? Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? This movie trailer is targeting families looking for a day out on a holiday - it reaches kids most. Those excluded would be those how don't celebrate this holiday. From what I gather removes the religious overtones too. It's aimed at dominant white America, as there is a lack of people of color and or characters of color in the trailer. Why is this message being sent? This message is targetting Kids as seen by the \"Try YouTube Kids\" link on the YouTube page. Since it is listed on YouTube Kids, it will more likely be seen by younger YouTube viewers. They will then ask their parents to see the movie. Whose history is portrayed in this message? Anyone how celebrates Easter via the Easter Bunny. Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value? Yes, this is a movie trailer intended to pull in a larger viewing audience. What is the story that this advertisement/message tells us about how we should behave? Looking at the trailer, it appears the main character is trying to help the animated characters fulfill some sort of goal. Toys R Us \"Making Wishes Come True\" Bus Full of Kids Commercial \u00b6 Who created this message? The YouTube page states, \"Toys R Us made the wishes of kids come true by taking them to Toys R Us and giving them anything they wanted. Making their dreams come true just in time for the holidays. Watch some of our kids as they express true joy.\" So this was put together to drive positive attention to the brand. Is Toys R Us still around? Which techniques are used to attract my attention? An upbeat jungle and a field trip pull the viewer along the Toys R Us adventure. How might different people interpret this message? I would want o know how I can get on the free toy list, is this just a publicity stunt or does Toys R Us donate toys to shelters? I think parents will see it as a publicity stunt, or if they are in poverty, feel emotional guilt for not being able to provide extravagant gifts. Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? These kids all look from middle-class families or at least they visited the wardrobe department before filming the commercial. It's also not filmed in an urban setting, suggesting suburbs. Why is this message being sent? Same as the previous video, this one also targets kids and is hosted on YouTube kids. I'm not sure why it is hosted by \"Tannen's Talent\" perhaps it is to recruit child actors? Are youth portrayed as powerful or weak in this message? Youth are portrayed as innocent, low-income parents might feel judged. Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value? Yes, this advertisement is trying to sell the idea of a positive brand. Is there a link between this commodity/message and happiness? Kids are happy to be receiving gifts of their choosing. Demonstrating material things bring comfort. Media Use Journal \u00b6 Has your choice for news or journalistic information changed over time? In what ways? Gowing up, the 5 o'clock network news was on when my father was home. I did not pay attention to what was being reported. I was disconnected from journalistic information through Middle School, High School, and even into my early adult years. It wasn't until a few years into college that I started paying attention to journalistic information; this would put me in my early twenties. I began my studies as a Fine Arts student, therefore my interest surrounded Art periodicals. I then branched into Anthropology, Political Science, and Sociology. Of course, this opened a wider array of journalistic media. I discovered NPR, and would listen to News Entertainment shows on the weekend, and then started tuning in to the weekday morning news cycles to better understand News Entertainment. As I continued in college, my journalistic information consumption continued to expand. As journalistic information slowly evolved and became widely distributed on the internet, my attention turned to online media. News aggregate feeds became reliable, and today I use Feedly & Google News aggregators. Both services allow unlimited sources to be combined into one news feed. I use each service differently, Feedly for personal interests and Google News for current events (World, Local). Is there a news story from your childhood that stands out to you as being particularly memorable? Did your perception of the world around you shift following your experience? In what ways? Note: Mainstream News programming can be particularly triggering for some. If memory is too traumatic to recount, please feel free to skip this question or consider reframing the question in a way that works for you. As mentioned in question one, I did not pay attention to the news networks growing up. Do you now actively seek out journalistic sources for information? If yes, what are those sources? What platforms do you use to access that information? Do you access different platforms for different types of news (i.e.; political, financial, sports, entertainment)? Currently, I do not seek out journalistic sources. The 2020 news cycle became increasingly absurd and I tuned out around July 2020, and have yet to tune back in fully. I do check in with local news via Colorado Public Radio; however, I read select articles and don't listen to the broadcasts. I scroll through my interest feeds in Feedly, but not nearly as often as I did pre-pandemic. These feeds include Art, Technology, and Education - primarily. I have opened my Google News aggregate feed, but this is not often. These feeds include World, Local, Politics, Entertainment, Technology, Science, Health... etc. What drives your choice above? Convenience? Perception of validity? Perception of fairness? Entertainment value? Price? All of the above? Using aggregate feeds, I have varied publishers that feed my news streams. This means I will see a variety of Headlines & Bylines and can see a fuller picture of what is being reported. These are Online publishers, some provide a limited number of free articles a month, others are unlimited. Most leading stories are covered similarly across multiple publishers; however, some stories are unique to publishers too. Does your choice for political journalism have a reputation as being \"left\", \"right\", \"liberal\", or \"conservative\" on the political spectrum? How do you know this to be the case? As mentioned in the previous question, using aggregate feeds allows me to combine news sources. I have chosen publishers across the political spectrum. Yes, news sources have been labeled left, right, liberal, conservative. However, when reading the articles this is not apparent in most mainstream publishers. I suppose people who only read headlines and are looking for information to support their worldview might disagree, but when you look at the reporting on a wider spectrum this begins to disappear - I think. Then there are those independent media channels that are aggressively trying to connect to people's worldviews, unfortunately. I would not consider these reputable news sources, but I am sure others would disagree. Do you only consume journalism or news sources that are produced in the U.S. for the U.S.? Which ones? What advantages and disadvantages are there to viewing diverse journalism sources? As mentioned in questions 3, 4, & 5, I consume a variety of Online media. These are aggregated from numerous sources. Sometimes publishers support the writing with audio and visual. Local news publishers, mainstream broadcast and print, or my least viewed sources. This is likely because they provide the least amount of information. I do read articles on Colorado Public Radio for local information. My Feedly feed has over 100 sources, printed in English and my Google feed has 29 sources, plus it fills in additional sources through an algorithm I presume. Print media is rare in my life, I suppose it saves trees. I do purchase books from my local independent book store. Are there ways that you feel you could be better informed? In what ways? What are alternative or supplemental news sources you could investigate to explore in the future? I feel informed. I am a curious person and am looking things up all the time. I think about things and search out relevant information for what's on my mind. I suppose that would be free-thinking. Tuning to network broadcast news doesn't interest me, as mentioned in question 3. I think mainstream media is an echo chamber and has been for a long time, they are all bidding for ratings and advertising money. It was roughly twenty years ago I realized that I could flip between broadcast stations and hear nearly identical coverage, the personalities were the only thing changing. I remember even here the same stories being reported at the same time. I think a question to ask, might be, what is \"news\" and what makes a person informed?

Not really. Under the question of the improvement, I mentioned that the site is difficult to navigate. I suppose if I was looking for something on this site I would adjust to the layout, but for just coming in for a quick review, I found it unclear. https://newseumed.org/medialiteracy What do you like about this resource and why?

Writing credits to Lee Eisenberg, Emily V. Gordon, Kumail Nanjiani, and Dan LeFranc. The episode for deconstruction is about how \"an undocumented high schooler's life is changed by an urban-squash coach\" (AppleTV+). Are they using this asset to illustrate a point that they're already making in your film? Yes, the series is based on true stories of immigrants in America. In an interview with Indie Wire Joshuah Bearman, the producer, states \"We sent our writers and researchers around the country to find these extraordinary tales from the lives of immigrants... Immigration has become a political issue, but not if you just tell people\u2019s ordinary stories. We wanted to make this show so that audiences could just get to know other people.\" (2019). This series is intended to help audiences relate to other people. Are they only using what is reasonably appropriate for the demonstration? The majority of the episode is dramatized reenactment. The names of the people and places were changed during the storytelling. I imagine this to meet the requirements of Fair Use: Don\u2019t defame the person. Don\u2019t invade privacy. Don\u2019t violate the Right of Publicity. At the conclusion of the episode, original materials are used to spotlight the real-life events of Reyna Pacheco, this also reveals a new layer to the story. It shows who the person is and what they went on to achieve after the story ends. The writers also published a biographical interview of each story in the series with Epic Magazine. I imagine this further supports the use of the materials since they hold the copyright to the biographical story. Criticisms and responses: From the US Squash website, it was noted that this episode received \"tremendous coverage across the world.\" With media outlets such as Rolling Stone, The Guardian, NPR's Weekend Edition, Chicago Sun-Times all praising this episode. Is the connection between what they're using and the point that they're illustrating clear to the average viewer? In the first frames of the episode is clearly stated that the episode is \"based on a true story.\" At the conclusion of the episode, original photos and video are followed by biographical text to draw the parallel from the dramatized story to the real-life events of the character. This supports the provisions of Fair Use by drawing historical context to the story, photos, and videos. Media Use Journal \u00b6 Did your parents or guardians have any rules or restrictions on how you used media? At the time did you agree with their policies? Why or why not? Looking back, would you give your parents different advice regarding those policies or rules? I do not recall my parents or guardians having media restrictions. I remember finances being a barrier in the selection of books and entertainment we consumed. Television and movies were sparse. I do not recall being turned away from or not being allowed to view select items. Video games were nowhere near the complexity they are today and the internet was not created when I was a child. However, I do remember when the \"Parental Advisory Explicit Content\" labels were brought to the public by Tipper Gore and other DC politicians in 1985. In my opinion, this was the introduction of government-sanctioned censorship and was unequally applied to the media industry (The Culture Trip). This legislative forced labeling greatly influenced my parent's point of view on what music was appropriate or not. Interestingly, censored versions played on the airwaves and the edited versions were bad at best. It was easy to fill in the blanks and has become a pop-culture parody - fill-in-the bleeps. In the film, Other Peoples Footage, I thought it was interesting that in the \"slipe and slide\" example of Fair Use, the young people in the film were using derivative \"curse\" words - altered language implying the same use. So it's not that \"explicit content\" isn't widely known, it's that US mainstream culture finds comfort in masking its existence. Today, one parent sees this as government censorship and the other see's it all as a cultural moral failure... so not sure how to advise them. Do you have/did you have any rules or restrictions for any young people in your life regarding their use of the media or electronics? Explain why or why not? I do not have rules or restrictions regarding the use of media or electronics for young people in my life. I think being open and honest with young people is most appropriate. Not being a parent, it's hard to say what rules or restrictions I would place on them. I would likely fall to the side of lead by example. In other words, if they have rules and restrictions then so would I. Thinking about the students you teach or the target audience for your final project, what do you think is the hardest part of being a young person in today's media environment? My final project is targeting Adult Basic Educators, therefore Adults. Educators are diverse in age, but a challenge some face is not being digitally literate. Not knowing terms of technology or how to navigate the digital landscape. Students oftentimes have to assist educators in doing digital tasks - that's a problem. Then there is a group of educators who have to bridge two generations; those coming up under them, students, and those who proceeded them, colleagues. I suppose this would be a challenge for a young person in today's media environment, in that the older generation doesn't understand this media landscape but they have the authority to dictate its use. I suppose that is the way it's always been. How do you think the landscape of the Internet will change in the next 10 years? Do you think it will change for the better? Why or why not? I currently see this as a \"hot topic\" of debate. What censorship, if any, should be applied to digital content. Who gets to be the censors? And how is censorship applied in a worldwide communication platform? Some countries are censoring their citizens from specific content and this is considered a rights violation by some. America is contemplating how to censor social media outlets - think fake news, misinformation, disinformation. Questions exist around digital copyrights in this highly malleable and shareable media. Over the next ten years, the digital landscape could go several ways. It could promote freedom and expression, move towards mass censorship and surveillance, or more likely, we will see new technology that meets both ends of the spectrum - VPN, Open Source Software, etc. I think the greater question is about how these diverging ideas will play out in society. Everyone has opinions and the internet is nothing more than a means to share information (media) but whose information will be valued and allowed to persist. Reflection \u00b6 Consider this statement: \u201cFair use is not a get out of jail free card. Use work and transform it, but understand the law.\u201d In what ways does this adequately sum up fair use? At 01:10:44 of the film, the speaker makes this statement. From their perspective, it doesn't mean you have the right to use everything but means you have the right to understand the law. Then, use work in transformative ways. It is not a \"get out of jail free\" card, as the speaker references the idea of Fair Use being a \"shield\". A transformative work may still be challenged in court but the artist has the right to defend themselves using the Fair Use exception in the statutory law, which has been building presidents supporting Fair Use over the last 10+ years. Why is fair use important as an artistic tool? In the film at 01:12:04, the speaker references Fair Use as an artistic tool, creating space allowing artists to present their work in an engaging and meaningful way. It's a way to bring important issues to the people. They continue stating it is a viable part of the law, protecting expressive rights, to the degree it is being used and it should continue to be regarded as normal. I can't help but read into this speaker's thoughts and think that at some point creative expression might move too far since they said in its current degree of use. How is it liberating or threatening to the filmmaker? The film makes explicit reference to liberating, twice. Once at 00:54:42 and again at 01:12:22. In both instances, the speakers bounce back to the idea of \"risk\". Even when Fair Use is \"rock solid\" pushback may come in many forms - threatening. Corporate interests, advertising, or institutions of power may stop the \"rock-solid\" work from ever being released. Lawsuits may be brought against the \"rock-solid\" works in frivolous legal challenges. Many artists consider this while determining if they should include other's original works in a transformative nature. On the flip side, large corporations and media conglomerates also use Fair Use but have a larger pool of resources at their disposal to protect them. One filmmaker spoke out against Fair Use because they did not like the idea that their media can be used in a context that they had not intended or the portrayals of subjects may change. They argued that it makes it difficult to protect the interests of those in the original works. This argument was discredited since this is the exact reason Fair Use exists, to allow for new expressions, purpose, and meanings to emerge. Using examples of films explored in Other People\u2019s Footage: Copyright & Fair Use, as well as other films, list the ways fair use has been an incredible source of creativity for documentary filmmakers. This entire film is based on the idea of Fair Use, demonstrating the \"rock-solid\" questions phrased as the Safe Harbor zone - legal speak in my mind. In the majority, if not all, the selected works in the film demonstrated the transformative nature required, reinforcing the filmmaker's point: is the use deemed appropriate, and does it convey a new message. When filmmakers move out of the \"safe harbor\" zone they are still \"shielded\" by the Fair Use exception but legal challenges become more likely. It would appear that this happens when the original work's message is transformed in a way that is disagreed upon. The film skips over ethical questions around creative expressions but the film \"Blackwater\" raised this question. That film used original audio and film that when combined - transformed - created a false narrative of events, a misrepresentation of what took place. The events happened, just not with that visual material (dramatic recreation). It was noted that the use was in the \"safe harbor\" zone creating new compelling audio and visual that supported the filmmaker's purpose and message. However, another filmmaker, at 00:47:20, stresses the point, just because we can use Fair Use in this way, should this type of transformation be allowed. This type of Fair Use is very well where we are at in the US media landscape surrounding \"fake news\", misinformation, and disinformation - as in who's narrative is the correct one - which expressions are valuable. Especially true when everyone is transforming the same original media into different narratives. \"Fair use is like a muscle; it gets bigger if you use it.\u201d Explain this statement. In the film, the speaker makes this statement at 01:12:48. This is about question 2 - Fair Use as an artistic tool. The speaker states that as long as people continue to regard this practice as \"normal\" then the collection of works open to transformative expressions will only continue to grow. Hence the analogy to building muscles. \u201cThe worst censors in the world are the scissors in the mind.\u201d Why does self-censorship happen and how can this negatively impact filmmakers? Many filmmakers were asked about \"self-censorship\" and my answer references back to question 3, how is Fair Use liberating and/or threatening. When a filmmaker or artist is determining the works to transform, it was voiced they need to step back and consider if corporate or media conglomerate interests will stifle their work from being seen. Will it be worth the legal challenges that may ensue? Even when the work is \"rock solid\" in the \"safe harbor\" zone private interests may prevail. However, the quote itself is from a copyright lawyer - consultant - Michael Donaldson at 01:13:49 and is summing up that the Fair Use exception has limitless - expansive - possibilities if the people utilizing the exception truly understand their rights in this area. Easier said when you're not having to defend the work under legal challenges. Standing up for your rights is challenging in the media world. Why is it important to teach students about copyright law and fair use? Explain your response. In a media dense culture and with creative expression at an all-time high, students need to understand their rights under US law. This in itself is difficult since we live in a global digital world and copyright law is not uniform from country to country. However, in the US, we teach US citizenship (US Civics), and this citizenship is now being explicitly extended to include digital citizenship. Online technologies allow a free exchange of copyrighted materials at lightning-fast speeds, and we have tools available to remix and transform materials in seconds. Students, and everyone, should be aware of how intellectual property laws may impact how they share forms of expression digitally. As brought up in questions 3, 4, and 6, Fair Use can be a liberating form of expression, however, it can also be threatening in how others may transform forms of expression or challenge their expressions. Students should be aware of both sides of the law to be better-informed citizens. Describe the term \u201cintellectual property\u201d with reference to copyright laws and the principles of fair use. Why do you think it\u2019s important to protect an individual\u2019s intellectual property? What challenges to fair use does this present? Intellectual property is the umbrella term that protects trademarks, copyrights, and patents. In my opinion, the law itself is antiquated and abused by institutions that hold power. For example, an individual may inadvertently sign away their intellectual property when employed, when using online technologies, or through academic scholarship. This often shows up in Noncompete Clauses, Terms of Service, or other Agreements. Time will tell if the legal interpretations of intellectual property will lean to protect individuals or private interests. Currently, individuals may be asking if it is worth the legal battle or having to consider these private interests before moving forward. At this juncture, the media landscape is expanding rapidly and the intellectual property law will be a challenge more and more, with new precedents setting the tone moving forward. Individual rights must prevail as it is foundational to democracy to be able to freely express oneself - even if it is in opposition to one's own beliefs. But the question here is, where do one person right end and another begin. Should all narratives be protected by Fair Use and who decides? I think this question is currently up for debate. There are some common misconceptions about circumstances permitting a particular usage to be considered fair use. Explain how the following characteristics do not automatically confer fair use: Age of the work; Out of print; Religious Use; Non-profit Use; and Personal Use. I did not see these misconceptions represented in the film, but I would suppose it falls in line with the film's premise, that nobody is above the intellectual (copyright) law. Knowing the law, and correct applications of Fair Use, is the only way to \"shield\" one's creative expressions from legal challenges - this point was mentioned repeatedly in the film. Just because you are creating creative works in one of the listed fields in the question, doesn't exempt an individual from this Federal law. Educational use was also not explicitly addressed in this film, however implicitly implied that documentary filmmakers are bringing new educational materials. Example is a critique of Stanley Kubrick's film at 00:08:53.","title":"Fair Use, Media Responsibility, and Digital Citizenship"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-18-fair-use-media-responsibility-and-digital-citizenship/#media-deconstruction","text":"Little America: The Jaguar, Season 1, Episode 2 IMDB describes Little America as, \"Inspired by the true stories featured by Epic Magazine, Little America will go beyond the headlines to look at the funny, romantic, heartfelt, inspiring and surprising stories of immigrants in America...\" Produced by Joshuah Bearman (Epic Magazine) Directed by Aurora Guerro. Writing credits to Lee Eisenberg, Emily V. Gordon, Kumail Nanjiani, and Dan LeFranc. The episode for deconstruction is about how \"an undocumented high schooler's life is changed by an urban-squash coach\" (AppleTV+). Are they using this asset to illustrate a point that they're already making in your film? Yes, the series is based on true stories of immigrants in America. In an interview with Indie Wire Joshuah Bearman, the producer, states \"We sent our writers and researchers around the country to find these extraordinary tales from the lives of immigrants... Immigration has become a political issue, but not if you just tell people\u2019s ordinary stories. We wanted to make this show so that audiences could just get to know other people.\" (2019). This series is intended to help audiences relate to other people. Are they only using what is reasonably appropriate for the demonstration? The majority of the episode is dramatized reenactment. The names of the people and places were changed during the storytelling. I imagine this to meet the requirements of Fair Use: Don\u2019t defame the person. Don\u2019t invade privacy. Don\u2019t violate the Right of Publicity. At the conclusion of the episode, original materials are used to spotlight the real-life events of Reyna Pacheco, this also reveals a new layer to the story. It shows who the person is and what they went on to achieve after the story ends. The writers also published a biographical interview of each story in the series with Epic Magazine. I imagine this further supports the use of the materials since they hold the copyright to the biographical story. Criticisms and responses: From the US Squash website, it was noted that this episode received \"tremendous coverage across the world.\" With media outlets such as Rolling Stone, The Guardian, NPR's Weekend Edition, Chicago Sun-Times all praising this episode. Is the connection between what they're using and the point that they're illustrating clear to the average viewer? In the first frames of the episode is clearly stated that the episode is \"based on a true story.\" At the conclusion of the episode, original photos and video are followed by biographical text to draw the parallel from the dramatized story to the real-life events of the character. This supports the provisions of Fair Use by drawing historical context to the story, photos, and videos.","title":"Media Deconstruction"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-18-fair-use-media-responsibility-and-digital-citizenship/#media-use-journal","text":"Did your parents or guardians have any rules or restrictions on how you used media? At the time did you agree with their policies? Why or why not? Looking back, would you give your parents different advice regarding those policies or rules? I do not recall my parents or guardians having media restrictions. I remember finances being a barrier in the selection of books and entertainment we consumed. Television and movies were sparse. I do not recall being turned away from or not being allowed to view select items. Video games were nowhere near the complexity they are today and the internet was not created when I was a child. However, I do remember when the \"Parental Advisory Explicit Content\" labels were brought to the public by Tipper Gore and other DC politicians in 1985. In my opinion, this was the introduction of government-sanctioned censorship and was unequally applied to the media industry (The Culture Trip).

Amazon (Amazon Prime, Amazon Video) created the trailer. Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum are executive producers, moving away from Project Runway (Bravo, Lifetime) in 2017 and began Marking the Cut in 2020. It looks as if they exited Project Runway when the studio producing it fell on hard times, being tied to The Wienstien Company and its declaration of bankruptcy. The rights of the show then bouncing to NBCUniversal. Project Runway then moved to both Lifetime and A&E Television, each partially owned by NBC (Wikipedia (Links to an external site.)). A person can speculate as to why Tim and Heidi left the show, but in interviews they noted rigid formatting, and low budget lead them to break paths from the series and develop a similar series for Amazon - Making the Cut (Refinery29 (Links to an external site.)). This new series has allowed the producers, Time Gunn and Heidi Klum) more creative liberties than the former series. As stated in an interview with Refinery29, the show has a larger budget and a platform to sell designers creations. Both of these allow the show to iterate and move forward with the theme of finding the next Global Fashion Brand. Additionally, the budget allows for the shows dynamics to change allowing designers the use of seamstresses, mimicking the real-world. In all, the message was created to publicize a new season of this updated reality television fashion design show. What creative techniques are used to attract my attention? Typical trailer effects are used. It is short (2:00) highlighting dramatic scenes with heavy bass sound effects. It alludes to drama on the reality television show, but also highlights the fashion creations to be seen throughout the series. The trailer highlights each of the judges and the fashion designers who will be in the season, and teases their personalities. The trailer also promotes the Amazon store for Making the Cut. After all the store front is an integral part of the reality television series. Bold wording draws the viewers eye to this marketing idea, \"Watch it, Wear it.\" How might different people understand this message differently from me? Amazon is a recognizable name as a retailer and media streaming company. Most viewers will understand that this is a trailer for a reality television series. We see each of the designers at sewing machines, receiving feedback, and portions of judging. We see models on runways, and high-end settings. The audio, both musical and character outtakes, lead the viewer to see that this is a drama based reality television series and not a do-it-yourself television show or a fashion show. Viewers may be inclined to judge themselves against this reality television series, noticing what they are wearing (fashion) and imagine if fashion could lead them to these glamorous places. The whole shows premise would be completely unrelatable to those with no interest in this sort of creative expression. There is an underlying aspect of consumerism and of competition highlighted in the trailer. Viewers are enticed to search out the show on Amazon to make purchases, now and with each new episode. The winning fashion designer wins an exclusive deal with the Amazon brands plus one-million dollars for the designers brand This might inspire or give a false sense to the complexities of the fashion world to viewers - I think Shark Tank might too. What lifestyles, values and points of view are represented in; or omitted from, this message? In the trailer, diversity in the fashion industry is represented. We see fashion designers, judges, and models from varying backgrounds. Paying attention to the models, we see different body types, races, ethnicities, and genders - important since fashion as blemished history here. We hear the producers express Making the Cuts purpose, finding the next global designer brand. We can hear the Judges points of view on why they are in the show. We can hear the incentives for the fashion designers. We can see teasers of the fashion to be created during the season and the drama. Within Refinery29 interview, Tim Gunn was excited that the fashion created on the show would be available on Amazon for around $100. Making the Cut is obviously targeting an audience that is interested in fashion and/or interested in the creation textile goods. Views not related to fashion design or the fashion industry are excluded. Everyone and everything in the trailer is intentionally set and glamorized. We won't see the average persons fashion being portrayed, as that goes against the premise of the reality show - moving fashion forward. Why is this message being sent? This message is being sent to create awareness for the upcoming season of Making the Cut. It is accessible through YouTube, but most content is located on Amazon. When visiting the webpage for the show which is neatly integrated into Amazon (Amazon Prime, and Amazon Prime Video) we can see this message is about much more than just a reality television show - as is the show itself. Making the Cut is blending together reality television, consumerist culture, and media influencers into something new. We've seen this in the likes of Disney - and others - creating entertainment to sell products, but this show is reaching a different audience. It is also incorporated into one of the worlds largest retailers - Amazon. Once on Amazon, you can purchase, the show, episodes, fashion from the episode, visit influencers pages who are endorsing products buy. This message is being sent to help all those involved profit from this reality television series through viewership. Media Artifact Interogation What counts as violence? In Making the Cut, economic disparities is ignored, showing only luxury and glamour. Aside from that, reality television in general, is known to produce drama by pitting characters against each other and overly harsh criticisms - manufacturing disfunction for drama (violence). What is made public or kept private within this message? When watching the episodes we learn that the fashion designers come from a variety of backgrounds and may have had different career aspirations early on. We learn about each designers through short biographies and not all designers come from a place of privilege. In fact, since the shows premise is to find the next Global Fashion Brand, designers come from across the globe - UK, US, India, Columbia, France and Poland (Fashion United (Links to an external site.)). Each of the designers have established brands, are entrepreneurs, and have visions for where to their brands identity. Newsweek (Links to an external site.) provides an easy to digest biography of each contestant. None of this is visible in the trailer. What would be the consequence of making the reverse true? Since the reality television show is about fashion and design, telling the story of designers in the trailer would not be marketing the reality factor of the show. However, finding a trailer highlighting the designers backstory may lead viewers into desiring to watch the reality television series. Changing the messaging could make the show more appealing to those with little interest in fashion design. Who benefits or loses in these differing situations? Making the Cut glamorizes an already glamorous field. The reality show is designed to produce profits for a variety interests. Of course this adds to economic disparities, as profits move upward. However, Making the Cut is highlighting fashion design entrepenuaers who are all self made and following their passions/interests. The fashion industry, itself, informs what we find acceptable, fashionable, and sways what is available at clothing retailers so the shoes impacts could reach everyone. ~How is violence conveyed in this message?~ ~Who is potentially harmed by this message?~ ~What does this message say about how pain should be expressed?~ ~Are youth portrayed as powerful or weak in this message?~ ~Who benefits from this portrayal?~ Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value? Making the Cut is designed for many interested parties to profit, including the hosts, judges, the entire production crew, the designers, Amazon, Social Media Influencers, etc. The fashion designers are creating goods to be sold on Amazon, with the incentive of winning an exclusive deal to sell their collection as an Amazon product. The reality television shows premise is to find the next global brand, this is selling the world a fashion identity. What these designer brands identify as fashionable, then trickles down to all manufactures. ~Why does this advertisement/message work on a cultural level?~ ~What is the story that this advertisement/message tells us about how we should behave?~ ~What is this advertisement or message telling us about what it means to be happy?~ ~Is there a link between this commodity/message and happiness?~ What does this advertisement convey what people want? Making the Cut advertises that people desire to look good through fashion. But it also highlights the creative passions of the designers. Media Use Journal \u00b6 How has your understanding changed since the beginning of our course? Through out the course I learned that stereotypes are alive and well, a little disheartening to realize. I found insight from the \"Mean World Syndrome\" in that those who consume more media develop false realities more often than those who limit their media consumption. However, this is already popularized in mainstream media - it is just politicized, left, right, liberal, conservative. I feel people are aware of this idea, and when they are countered by an opposing view, they refer the opposition to a different source of information - leaning the opposite way. I am beginning to wonder if it is even possible to create unbiased news because there is always someone profiting from the exposure of the stories or someone funding the work. Besides people like trending topics and sometimes make these topics trend - so popular content will exist. But at the same time wouldn\u2019t this be excluding voices? Has your awareness of the power of the media shifted? In what ways? I think the US or at least subcultures in the US are deeply involved in critical consciousness (sociopolitical development). I was looking at upcoming movie and television developments earlier in the year, and came across subgroups who are challenging studio choices for actors portraying characters and were successfully influencing studio choices. They were concerned that the actors should have the same background as the character, i.e. nationality (born and raised) not look. I also came across interviews with some actors questioning if roles portraying LGBTQ+ characters should be filled strictly by LBGTQ+ actors. So maybe these are examples of sociopolitical development in action to be looked at in future classes? Do you have new concerns or feelings about media that were not present before this course? The course ended with the emerging theory of sociopolitical development. My understanding is the theory is an extension of Critical Consciousness which centers on systems of oppression and action. But like I stated in the reflection, the US suffers from a disagreement of what oppression is - causing many divides. It was said either in this class or elsewhere, that if we create something there will be somebody out there who disagrees with it, feels excluded, or finds offense to it. I feel this is what we have been looking for in this course - the negatives. Is it possible to have media that clears the five essential questions? Can critical media analysis happen revealing the positives? If you could add another week to this course, what should I have covered that we didn't address in this course? If we were to add another week to class, we could investigate trending stories as a whole. I felt we looked at artistic expressions, advertising, broadcast/streaming media, but ignored a while host of works being published in popular culture. We spent the weeks using the essential five questions, but won\u2019t these always reveal negatives? Are there frameworks available for educators, designers, and media producers to use to verify diversity, inclusion, and equity in our work? Are there more critical media formulas or frameworks to explore? We bridged into critical consciousness (sociopolitical development) at the end, but doesn\u2019t this rely on building group collectives that share common ideals of oppression? I think I have additional Media Use Journal information in the reflection... Reflection \u00b6 Watts, R.J., Griffith, D.M. & Abdul-Adil, J. (1999) Sociopolitical development as an antidote for oppression\u2014theory and action. Am J Community Psychol 27,2. pp.255\u2013271. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022839818873 Watts, R., Hipolito-Delgado, C. (2015) Thinking ourselves to liberation?: Advancing sociopolitical action in critical consciousness. Urban Review. 47,5. pp.847-867. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11256-015-0341-x Describe your understanding of the concept of sociopolitical development. Using this definition as a guide, do you agree with the Watts' viewpoint that sociopolitical development is vital to human development and the creation of a just society? Why or why not? Critical consciousness describes the process by which oppressed and socially marginalized people critically analyze their social and economic conditions and take action to improve them (Freire 1970) (Watts & Hipolito-Delgado, 2015). Sociopolitical development is the psychological process that leads to and supports social and political action (Watts et al., 2009). As mentioned in the quiz question similar to this reflection question, I have a difficult time distinguishing how sociopolitical development is a separate theory from the its base, critical consciousness theory. Is it in the framework or steps to develop critical consciousness? Searching this on the internet reveals little information other than it is an emerging theory - framework. In my search, I stumbled upon The National Equity Project (Links to an external site.). It appears to be full of research (Links to an external site.), resources (Links to an external site.) and frameworks (Links to an external site.) to challenge and raise awareness to systematic oppression. It lead me to the Instagram #liberatorydesign (Links to an external site.). I think this leads to my answer whether I agree with Watts' viewpoint. For the duration of my work within Adult Basic Education, I have instructed, developed, and implemented curriculum that would lead Adult learners to critical analysis of media presented to them. Most of this media would then be later tested through standardized testing. As a result, often times we would have to also instruct test taking strategies for the standardized tests. There are several reasons for this need. One that stands out, in light of this question, is that students critical analysis doesn't always align to the analysis that the standardized test is expecting. Standardized testing, in itself, is a separate discussion; but it does tie into the idea of developing critical consciousness which standardized testing may discourage. Moving externally, from the classroom to community, I have found discourse supports the notion that sociopolitical development is necessary. When speaking about systematic oppression it is easy to remove oneself from it impacts. Example would be talking to a person who doesn't understand that they carry privilege; they themselves are impoverished. How could they have privilege? But when building from their experience and critically looking at the affects of their environment, they may begin to see how they are viewed differently than others around them. Discussing different experiences does, in fact, reveal privilege that others do not have. In my mind, this is developing critical consciousness (sociopolitical development). Of course, this is actionable if the person who is gaining new insights is willing to release that privilege they carry or challenge the system that is supporting inequality. With the incredible news cycle we have been experiencing in the last few months, these articles speak to the important and crucial role that media literacy plays in developing citizenship skills. How does this notion connect to the Watts' article on sociopolitical development? With our current news cycles I found insight to this phenomenon from the documentary, \"The Mean World Syndrome.\" After viewing the documentary, I walked away with the understanding that those who take in more information from media channels begin to develop false realities based on those channels. The connection I inferred from this idea is that those who are overly consumed by medias, have less time to actually interact with those around them. Thinking back to 2020, we were in a great isolation period and to this day some are still not connected people around them. It was my thinking that this is how peoples perceptions became so divided - or rather exasperated the divide. Those that were at one time connected to those around them and community, had lost that connection. Some relied heavily on media networks to keep them in the loop - creating false media realities. Others found Social Media networks to be their new friend and joined in the trends of eating, baking, workouts, etc. To this extent, we are influenced by what we interact with - peer pressure comes to mind here. One thing I haven't figured out, is who's view of reality is the correct one, especially when looking through the lens of critical consciousness (sociopolitical development). There is not an agreement of what oppression is in the US at large. Citizens grapple with the complexities of where rights end and where others' rights begin. I had a colleague describing a diversity, equity, and inclusion training that first focused on LGBTQ+ inclusion, then was followed by faith inclusion. The faith based speaker felt they were no longer \"safe\" and \"closeted\" in their workplaces because of the others inclusion. The answer seems obvious to me that all people belong, but some have deep engrained points of view of what is right vs. wrong. The fact that stereotypes are still a driving narrative in media shows that we haven't moved to the point of allowing others to exists as who they are, in peace. Besides marketers forming profiles of who people are, we also have hate groups to contend with. Each placing people into boxes and perpetuating forms of oppression. With sociopolitical development, it is intended to engage the viewer in critical analysis of their environments. The Young Warriors program entered the study with an interesting view of rap music and the entertainment the young people engaged with. However, with media interrogation, or leading questions, the researchers were able to have the students vocalize oppression in their surroundings. But then again, this oppression was already vocalized in music and entertainment being questioned - without verifying the media used in the program, this assumption is based on my knowledge of 90s rap music. Therefore the students made it known to the researchers that the oppression in the media was in fact in their experiences and communities too. I suppose the sociopolitical questions removed the glamorization of the entertainment industry, but wouldn't this be exposing economic disparities? Like most growing up, the young people saw those who had things that were unattainable to them, unfortunately this extended beyond material things and into being stable and part of a safe community - I can relate there. But was rap music perpetuating this oppression, or other factors? Since the 90s, and earlier, we have seen a changing force within rap most notably from the hip-hop counter-culture, driving positivity back into the messaging. So how does all this work with our current news cycles, when what I read and see in media doesn't align to what I hear and see out my front door? When I have friends who tell me about their experiences and when I share them no one believes that the experience could be true. Is it because they aren't connected to the place of events? Or because it's not popularized in the news cycle? Or a combination of both. I see one crucial element missing in developing a critical consciousness (sociopolitical development), in that we need to first agree one what oppression is and who is being oppressed? I feel the US has many differing views on this currently. If we are to be critically looking at media and analyzing how it is perpetuating oppressive processes, don't we need to have a common idea of oppression? Or would this be informed by the collective process of sociopolitical development?","title":"Exploring Media Literacy's role in Sociopolitical Development"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-25-exploring-media-literacys-role-in-sociopolitical-development/#media-deconstruction","text":"YouTube: Making the Cut, Season 2 (Trailer) Who created this message? Amazon (Amazon Prime, Amazon Video) created the trailer. Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum are executive producers, moving away from Project Runway (Bravo, Lifetime) in 2017 and began Marking the Cut in 2020. It looks as if they exited Project Runway when the studio producing it fell on hard times, being tied to The Wienstien Company and its declaration of bankruptcy. The rights of the show then bouncing to NBCUniversal. Project Runway then moved to both Lifetime and A&E Television, each partially owned by NBC (Wikipedia (Links to an external site.)). A person can speculate as to why Tim and Heidi left the show, but in interviews they noted rigid formatting, and low budget lead them to break paths from the series and develop a similar series for Amazon - Making the Cut (Refinery29 (Links to an external site.)). This new series has allowed the producers, Time Gunn and Heidi Klum) more creative liberties than the former series. As stated in an interview with Refinery29, the show has a larger budget and a platform to sell designers creations. Both of these allow the show to iterate and move forward with the theme of finding the next Global Fashion Brand. Additionally, the budget allows for the shows dynamics to change allowing designers the use of seamstresses, mimicking the real-world. In all, the message was created to publicize a new season of this updated reality television fashion design show. What creative techniques are used to attract my attention? Typical trailer effects are used. It is short (2:00) highlighting dramatic scenes with heavy bass sound effects. It alludes to drama on the reality television show, but also highlights the fashion creations to be seen throughout the series. The trailer highlights each of the judges and the fashion designers who will be in the season, and teases their personalities. The trailer also promotes the Amazon store for Making the Cut. After all the store front is an integral part of the reality television series. Bold wording draws the viewers eye to this marketing idea, \"Watch it, Wear it.\" How might different people understand this message differently from me? Amazon is a recognizable name as a retailer and media streaming company. Most viewers will understand that this is a trailer for a reality television series. We see each of the designers at sewing machines, receiving feedback, and portions of judging. We see models on runways, and high-end settings. The audio, both musical and character outtakes, lead the viewer to see that this is a drama based reality television series and not a do-it-yourself television show or a fashion show. Viewers may be inclined to judge themselves against this reality television series, noticing what they are wearing (fashion) and imagine if fashion could lead them to these glamorous places. The whole shows premise would be completely unrelatable to those with no interest in this sort of creative expression. There is an underlying aspect of consumerism and of competition highlighted in the trailer. Viewers are enticed to search out the show on Amazon to make purchases, now and with each new episode. The winning fashion designer wins an exclusive deal with the Amazon brands plus one-million dollars for the designers brand This might inspire or give a false sense to the complexities of the fashion world to viewers - I think Shark Tank might too. What lifestyles, values and points of view are represented in; or omitted from, this message? In the trailer, diversity in the fashion industry is represented. We see fashion designers, judges, and models from varying backgrounds. Paying attention to the models, we see different body types, races, ethnicities, and genders - important since fashion as blemished history here. We hear the producers express Making the Cuts purpose, finding the next global designer brand. We can hear the Judges points of view on why they are in the show. We can hear the incentives for the fashion designers. We can see teasers of the fashion to be created during the season and the drama. Within Refinery29 interview, Tim Gunn was excited that the fashion created on the show would be available on Amazon for around $100. Making the Cut is obviously targeting an audience that is interested in fashion and/or interested in the creation textile goods. Views not related to fashion design or the fashion industry are excluded. Everyone and everything in the trailer is intentionally set and glamorized. We won't see the average persons fashion being portrayed, as that goes against the premise of the reality show - moving fashion forward. Why is this message being sent? This message is being sent to create awareness for the upcoming season of Making the Cut. It is accessible through YouTube, but most content is located on Amazon. When visiting the webpage for the show which is neatly integrated into Amazon (Amazon Prime, and Amazon Prime Video) we can see this message is about much more than just a reality television show - as is the show itself. Making the Cut is blending together reality television, consumerist culture, and media influencers into something new. We've seen this in the likes of Disney - and others - creating entertainment to sell products, but this show is reaching a different audience. It is also incorporated into one of the worlds largest retailers - Amazon. Once on Amazon, you can purchase, the show, episodes, fashion from the episode, visit influencers pages who are endorsing products buy. This message is being sent to help all those involved profit from this reality television series through viewership. Media Artifact Interogation What counts as violence? In Making the Cut, economic disparities is ignored, showing only luxury and glamour. Aside from that, reality television in general, is known to produce drama by pitting characters against each other and overly harsh criticisms - manufacturing disfunction for drama (violence). What is made public or kept private within this message? When watching the episodes we learn that the fashion designers come from a variety of backgrounds and may have had different career aspirations early on. We learn about each designers through short biographies and not all designers come from a place of privilege. In fact, since the shows premise is to find the next Global Fashion Brand, designers come from across the globe - UK, US, India, Columbia, France and Poland (Fashion United (Links to an external site.)). Each of the designers have established brands, are entrepreneurs, and have visions for where to their brands identity. Newsweek (Links to an external site.) provides an easy to digest biography of each contestant. None of this is visible in the trailer. What would be the consequence of making the reverse true? Since the reality television show is about fashion and design, telling the story of designers in the trailer would not be marketing the reality factor of the show. However, finding a trailer highlighting the designers backstory may lead viewers into desiring to watch the reality television series. Changing the messaging could make the show more appealing to those with little interest in fashion design. Who benefits or loses in these differing situations? Making the Cut glamorizes an already glamorous field. The reality show is designed to produce profits for a variety interests. Of course this adds to economic disparities, as profits move upward. However, Making the Cut is highlighting fashion design entrepenuaers who are all self made and following their passions/interests. The fashion industry, itself, informs what we find acceptable, fashionable, and sways what is available at clothing retailers so the shoes impacts could reach everyone. ~How is violence conveyed in this message?~ ~Who is potentially harmed by this message?~ ~What does this message say about how pain should be expressed?~ ~Are youth portrayed as powerful or weak in this message?~ ~Who benefits from this portrayal?~ Is this message trying to sell a product, an idea, or value? Making the Cut is designed for many interested parties to profit, including the hosts, judges, the entire production crew, the designers, Amazon, Social Media Influencers, etc. The fashion designers are creating goods to be sold on Amazon, with the incentive of winning an exclusive deal to sell their collection as an Amazon product. The reality television shows premise is to find the next global brand, this is selling the world a fashion identity.

But it also highlights the creative passions of the designers.","title":"Media Deconstruction"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-25-exploring-media-literacys-role-in-sociopolitical-development/#media-use-journal","text":"How has your understanding changed since the beginning of our course?

Programs have a common goal of supporting adult learners to move into College and Career Training programs, furthering their education. Colorado Adult Educators are Federally mandated to align their curriculum to the College and Career Readiness Standards for Adult Education (CCRS PDF) - the top tier of the Common Core State Standards. For those serving English acquisition students, the English Language Proficiency Standards for Adult Education (ELP PDF) provide additional correspondences or standards to support adult learners in meeting the CCR Standards. Being aware that Adult Educators are developing lessons based in standards, learning topics should be easily aligned to these. Fortunately, the standards are flexible and are easily aligned to a variety of content. Example, lets look at CCR Standard 1, as well as the corresponding ELP Standards: Anchor Standard 1 Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text. ELP Standard 1 An ELL can\u2026 construct meaning from oral presentations and literary and informational text through level-appropriate listening, reading, and viewing. ELP Standard 9 An ELL can\u2026 create clear and coherent level-appropriate speech and text. This example shows that the topic of Media Literacy can easily be aligned to this standard. Adult Educators following a close reading strategy of content specific questions, will be able to modify or extend questioning to a media literacy focus. Anchor Standard 1, asks Adult Educators to support student literacy in understanding what is explicitly and implicitly stated within texts. The ELP Standard 1 & 9, ensures additional support for English acquisition students to express their understandings of Anchor Standard 1. To incorporate multimedia support, and deeper analysis, Adult Educators can look to the standards under the Integration of Knowledge. Anchor Standard 7, moves away from text only documents and begins to build in 21st Century Digital Media skills, again with corresponding support for English acquisition student learners. Anchor Standard 7 Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats, including visually and quantitatively, as well as in words. ELP Standard 1 An ELL can\u2026 construct meaning from oral presentations and literary and informational text through level-appropriate listening, reading, and viewing. A recommendation to the organization will be made to develop a microlearning module specifically for standards aligned lesson plan development. Identify your media format needs and preference. Describe which media format(s) will work best, and why. Since this lesson is part of a professional learning microlearning module, short media would be most appropriate. Short media may include text snippets, print advertisements, political cartoons, and even short video clips (TikTok style). Not all will be included in this topic, as microlearning should be short and focused (15 minutes or less). The topic developed for this final project aims to support Adult Educators and Adult Education programs in understanding how to implement and explore Media Literacy in the classroom. To accomplish this, resources, references, and lesson templates would be appropriate. The design of the topic content, should be easily digestible by the learner. So keeping media short but relevant is the goal. The topic will include content addressed in Question 2 of this document. To further engage learners in the topic, the text will be complemented by audio summaries of the content. Audio narration will connect the learner to the presenter and may be viewed as an example of utilizing new technology in instruction. References and sources to external sites will further support learner understandings and allow for individual exploration of the topic. A sample lesson has been selected from Newseum and will be provided to learners to trial. Furthering the learning goals and objectives of this topic, learners will share these trial experiences and will be challenged to modify or extend a lesson using the information provided. To support learners in the application of the topic content, the learning design for the professional learning includes a microlearning specific discussion space. Learners will be able to share their ideas, lessons, and find support among their peers, as well as from a topic moderator. Describe how you have addressed copyright issues such as public domain documents and Fair Use laws. As this project falls under educational use (professional learning) \u201cFair Use\u201d may be applied. However, proper attributions, citations, and references will be noted. This not only adheres to copyright laws, but also provides transparency and legitimacy to the topic. As noted in Question 4, short media including text snippets, print advertisements, political cartoons, and even short video clips (TikTok style) may be incorporated into the topic. Do no harm. Describe how your teaching will be mindful of the potential challenges and harm possible in using media documents. Reflect on potential challenges and harm in using this lesson with your students. Describe how your media choice is appropriate. Learners participating in this microlearning topic will be provided resources to engage student learners in Media Literacy. Learners will be building and extending close reading strategies to include the process of critical analysis through the lens of Media Literacy. The topic will familiarize learners with the types of questions they will be raising with their student populations. To note, most Adult Educators use vendor-created materials, which are aligned to Federal Standards (CCSS), and mimic the standardized testing Adult learners are intended to pass (GED, HiSET, TASC). However, Adult Educators do incorporate self selected material to make learning more meaningful to their adult students. An example lesson has been selected from Newseum, and includes curated media examples. However, it is noted in the lesson that educators may bring in their own content. The idea of \"do no harm\" will be brought to the learners attention in their media selection process. Learners will need to think about their audience and curate materials that meet the literacy levels within their classrooms. It is also an opportunity to have students self select media to analyze. The learners targeted for this topic are Adult Educators and Adult Education programs. These educators are passionate and strive to best support Adult learners in understanding the materials they are engaging with through open engaging dialogue. However, it is inevitable that some media may be challenging for the student learners in explicit and implicit messaging. Adult Educators are aware that many Adult learners carry hidden trauma and it would be poor practice to not properly introduce - setup or frame - this type of material. But then again, Adult Educators don't always know the trauma carried by their learners and should be thinking about how to create a safe space for all learners to engage and participate. It should be brought to the learners attention that having clear instructional objectives will help in discussing challenging topics brought up through Media Literacy questions. A recommendation to the organization will be made to develop a microlearning module specifically for Trauma informed practices. How will you evaluating student learning? What media literacy outcomes do you want to measure? Is there a media literacy assessment tool or model you can adapt for your use? As part of the organization learning design, formative assessments are incorporated into the microlearning modules. These can be multiple choice or matching based on the examples to support learners retention of topic ideas. The design also includes learner engagement in the microlearning topic forum as an assessment tool. Learners participating in this topic will be able to discuss the topics presented, share ideas, lessons, and find support among their peers - forums are moderated. Another component of assessment in the learning design for the organizations professional learning is project-based. Within this topic, learners will be challenged to trial a Media Literacy lesson. After trialing the lessons, learners will be challenged to modify, extend, or develop an original lesson with the focus on Media Literacy. Learners may opt to use any of the topics resources, references, or ideas to accomplish this. These new lessons will be shared in the microlearning topic forum. The organizations learning design has embedded one last assessment, a learner interview, a chance for the organization to gain insights to the learners successes and struggles. All the above assessments will be used to inform future iterations of the the learning topic.","title":"Design Document"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5300/2021-07-31-final-projects/#media-literacy-microlearning","text":"Identify your curriculum and content goals. The curriculum and content for this project will be incorporated into a microlearning module to inform Colorado Adult Educators about what Media Literacy & Reader Response. Learners will discovery what these topics are and why they are important to include it into their curriculum mapping. The microlearning module will be distributed through the Colorado Adult Education Professional Association ( CAEPA ). The microlearning module will be presented through three topics, an introduction, media literacy, and reader response. Each topic will extend the learners prior knowledge of literacy instruction, and introduce new techniques to utilize with their student learners. The microlearning module will adhere (align) with the professional learning model designed in 5100, which is currently being implemented by the organization. The overall professional learning project is in early Alpha Development, see Moodle . As part of the learning design for the CAEPA's Professional Learning, microlearning modules will include resources, project-based learning, and community support. These aspects will be part of the topic developed for the final project. Goal: Have Colorado Adult Educators use Media Literacy and Reader Response with lessons meeting the College and Career Readiness Standards ( CCRS ). Topic 1: Introduction - Learners will be introduced to the concepts of Media Literacy & Reader Response. Topic 2: Media Literacy - Learners will build upon prior knowledge of close reading strategies and connect Media Inquiry techniques. Topic 3: Reader Response - Learners will understand how Reader Response techniques can be incorporated into literacy instruction. Topic 2 Learning Objectives: Learners will recognize questions to ask in each stage of critical analysis relating to media literacy. Learners will interpret the flow of critical analysis questions relating to media literacy. Learners will develop lessons incorporating Media Literacy. Identify media literacy and critical thinking goals. The Media Literacy - microlearning topic - will be viewed in an asynchronous learning environment. Learners should be able to complete the topic in 15-20 minutes. To make it valuable and relevant to learners, a few techniques will be presented, including: TeachHub Lateral Reading vs. Vertical Reading MediaLit Five Key Questions Form Foundation for Media Inquiry Newseum Is This Story Share-Worthy? College and Career Readiness College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Reading These techniques should build upon Adult Educator's knowledge of literacy instruction. As an example, close reading strategies have long been utilized and presented in trainings to help connect student learners to the reading content and develop critical thinking skills. Close reading is based on staggered critical analysis questions specifically designed for the content being examined. Questions support student learners in comprehension and critical analysis of the content. Resources provided in this topic should inspire new questions to ask in close reading lessons, with a focus on developing Media Literacy. Address Common Core and other learning standards.

I felt a need to create something exposing Denver\u2019s Homelessness problem. I have no idea why this is not being reported more widely, or at least I have not heard or seen any news about the growing number of homeless in Denver County. It is saddening, and during the cold snap and snow storm I watched people cycle through and warm themselves in my buildings entry way - in hourly rotations. I even think some were sleeping in our entryway and possibly hallway. I had to think to myself, are they trespassing? Should I care? Should I call someone and report this?

I would say my time was equally split between finding public domain images, googling how-to do stuff, doing stuff, and touching up the finer details. I stretched to pull together a vision, and I feel good about getting it onto the page. I stretched and flexed skills from other Adobe products and stumbled around in photoshop. I think using the background removal tool really saved me a lot of time, effort, confusion, so useful. I pushed myself to remove the mountains and manipulate an image of a homeless encampment in its place. That actually might have taken an additional hour or more...

This is a project we have been trying to figure out for awhile. This is our inaugural effort. Requirements \u00b6 Record your own Zoom segment of a Zoom Goldberg Machine, like above. Use a ball or any common moving object to trigger three or more reactions as it moves from left to right. The first item must intersect with multiple other items, and send a final exit-item off-screen - -> to the next Zoomer. For the sake of consistency we are encouraging you to use one of the following for your exit-item: white ping-pong ball, white golf ball, toilet paper roll, paper towel roll, light bulb, crunched-up paper, an orange, a banana, or a pencil. Zoom Goldberg Machine Backstory \u00b6 How does a person make a chain-reaction machine with items and the space available at home. I thought up many contraptions to move a ball about, but each was one-step. When I thought about moving to the next step, I no longer had room. I was also struggling thinking of anything that would create a substantial video. So, instead I decided to take the \u201cZoom\u201d aspect and run with it. Creating multiple independent machines, that when connected through a zoom-like video conference, it would appear as a digital chain reaction. I know this is part of the larger plan, but hey, I made something fun! Process \u00b6 Lots of brainstorming! I started by location scouting to find some areas outdoors to build some Rube Goldberg machines, but then I didn\u2019t have any materials with me, poor planning. So the next venture I brought limited supplies to begin simply. During the first round of recording, I realized that each shot was going to need to be from certain angles, in order to have a fluid motion presented on screen. So I recaptured some elements from multiple angles and thought it would provide options during editing. Enter editing. As I was going through the source materials, I started to sequence the machines together. While doing this, I also made text frames with notes about what should come next and a direction of movement. Of course I needed to reshoot pieces and as these moved along, I also had to build more machines to fill the next frame. Once the process was started, linking one frame to the next, it became less of a challenge and more hands one creativity. With more time, I could keep going, and refine each machines movements and fill in more blanks, but am pretty happy with the limited chain reactions it did physically produce. Time & Stretch \u00b6 This project took at least a full-day, maybe two. Between filming, building, and editing, there was plenty of downtime and distractions, but it took awhile. I started by trying out Adobe Premiere Rush recording feature in the app. Works pretty well, maybe even better than the built in video recorder? It also allowed me to instantly start building out the project in the app and syncs right to the Creative Suite. It also imports straight into Adobe Premiere for the finer editing. This was a first for using the process and it works wonders! As I was moving through the project, I thought it might be clever to build in some shots that utilized zoom-like backgrounds. For this I needed to create a stage, in order to use Adobe Premieres keying effects. This was my second trial replacing backgrounds using the software, and this time I used the difference method. It requires the use of a still image of the background, new background, and then the video. I learned you can capture a still image frame right in Adobe. Setting up the stage was key to success and really taking control of the lighting - lessons learned from my first trial. I think it worked great this time around. This project required lots of resizing and movement of videos. It also required each video to also have a still frame image to keep it on the screen after playback. When I started editing, I thought I considered every action that was going to be done, but I guess it\u2019s the nature of editing that things may change. I zoomed in on all the frames, and this disrupted my still images - so lots of readjustments. I fine tuned my trimming abilities with each clip and I also figured out how to place the images on the screen by using some math and calculating some X, Y coordinates. It's really about the small progressions. In all, I feel my Adobe Premiere Pro skill set solidifying and really getting a grasp on some basic effects and manipulation.

Tell a story using either 10 still images, 10 short video segments, or a combination of both. You choose the topic, the characters, etc. You can use any tool you'd like to achieve it--slideshows, collage, video, PowerPoint, or something else. Once you're done, post it to the # Mini-things channel. YouTube: Tell a Story in Ten Frames Backstory \u00b6 The idea for a story in ten frames came together organically. As I was thinking through initial ideas, I became aware that this project lends itself to make some very complex stories. I was thinking, children's books are illustrated in ten frames; people purchase homes in ten frames; most magazines, news, or online articles might not even make ten frames... So, I dialed it back. Well, at least I thought I did until I started producing. The idea for \"Meditations\" came to me in the park. I thought I was going in one direction, but after some time outdoors, I ended up here. The story itself is loose, and I think it plays to the soundtrack and the essence of mediation... let yourself go and leave the world behind. Process \u00b6 To start things out, I first located media resources. After I knew media was available, I started producing. I first needed to sync up the original video with the new soundtrack. I imported both of these into Adobe Premiere. I cut the soundtrack to a start and end, then started trimming down the video. I started at the beginning, slowly modifying along the way. I spent some quality time in the first minute of the video. The soundtrack lends itself to have visual emphasis, so that was a piece of the challenge - syncing the sounds and sights up. I thought of this during the creative process. I went through the audio track and placed markers at points of emphasis throughout the soundtrack. I then adjusted the video timings using the \"rate adjustment\" tool. The markers were used as markers or guides to sync everything. The video was extended and shorted as need, even tossed some parts. While adjusting the video, I noticed that there were some slow zooms in and out. This would cause issues with a mask unless I matched them. So, I went through and placed markers on the video denoting zooms. While doing this, I located a frame to export to Photoshop to create the image mask. In Photoshop, I outlined the person, and filled it in black, and then exported the image mask back into Premiere. I then layered, masked, and synced zooms. I then imported the ten frames and synced those to the soundtrack using the markers created earlier. I circled back to adjust the opacity to the video changes. Oh, and early in the process, I created the title sequence - as short as it is; and then crated the credits to close out the project. Time & Stretch \u00b6 This project took 8 hours. I anticipated 4 hours. As the creative process goes, once I started remixing the original video and mixing in the original music, new ideas came into play. Throughout the many projects up to this point, each has allowed me to develop and learn new techniques. This project allowed me to combine multiple techniques, from photoshop to premiere. It is empowering when the tools facilitate the creative process and are not a barrier. I would have liked to experiment and try to implementing a \"glitch\" technique into one of my next projects. This one has a lot already going on... I even reversed a couple of videos - forward then backwards - that was fun. Still working to get a hang of the image masks.

As I was thinking through initial ideas, I became aware that this project lends itself to make some very complex stories. I was thinking, children's books are illustrated in ten frames; people purchase homes in ten frames; most magazines, news, or online articles might not even make ten frames... So, I dialed it back. Well, at least I thought I did until I started producing. The idea for \"Meditations\" came to me in the park. I thought I was going in one direction, but after some time outdoors, I ended up here. The story itself is loose, and I think it plays to the soundtrack and the essence of mediation... let yourself go and leave the world behind.","title":"Backstory"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5340/2021-04-03-mini-storything-5/#process","text":"To start things out, I first located media resources. After I knew media was available, I started producing. I first needed to sync up the original video with the new soundtrack. I imported both of these into Adobe Premiere. I cut the soundtrack to a start and end, then started trimming down the video. I started at the beginning, slowly modifying along the way. I spent some quality time in the first minute of the video. The soundtrack lends itself to have visual emphasis, so that was a piece of the challenge - syncing the sounds and sights up. I thought of this during the creative process. I went through the audio track and placed markers at points of emphasis throughout the soundtrack. I then adjusted the video timings using the \"rate adjustment\" tool. The markers were used as markers or guides to sync everything. The video was extended and shorted as need, even tossed some parts. While adjusting the video, I noticed that there were some slow zooms in and out. This would cause issues with a mask unless I matched them.

This week's lesson referenced an early video work and thought that would work into the news highlights, which are typically used to emphasize the dialogue. I contacted both producers of content and asked permission to use their works. Initially, I was going to do a live-action performance but ended up going in a different direction. I choose to use a screen reader. I copied the text into a note. Then I began rearranging and trimming down the text to fit neatly into the original footage. I then created the news captions in Illustrator and layered them into the original footage. I also layered in the highlight footage. The last thing was to add in the credits at the end. At this point, it was complete, but inspiration hit again. I thought to change up more aspects of the original footage. I started masking up the title sequence with little details, name, class, etc. I was content keeping the original host in the frame and found it funny, but I decided to go a step further and place an image in their place.

I warmed up my critical mind by revisiting Hern's words on education, exploring history and pedagogy. In the opening lines, Hern makes a statement that resonates with me, \"It is an equation that I want to challenge in its entirety\" (2003, p. 3). The equation Hern is referring to, is that schooling equals education... and yet we know learning happens in a variety of contexts. Hern questions, \"why do we call reading a book and retaining the information 'teaching yourself,' but hearing someone else convey the same information as 'being taught'?\" (2003, p. 70). I find this particularly relevant in our \"digital\" age. Furthermore, time and time again, experiences (education) gained through informal learning is disregarded as not equal to that of formal learning, i.e. diplomas and certificates, and creates confusion among other aspects of society. \"The pupil is thereby 'schooled' to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new... medical treatment is mistaken for healthcare\" and the list continues (Illich, 1970). In my undergrad I took interest in the history of education. This is where Hern enters the discussion in Field Day. The narrative begins to break down the \"business\" of schooling - corporations and governments - and they both circle around power. Oh so many problems stem from these institutions of power and have influenced the equation Hern seeks to challenge... systems designed to self-perpetuate. A few pages in, Hern makes a great point relating to pedagogy, \"contemporary theories of teaching have largely developed around the functional necessities of mass schooling\" (2003, p. 8). This point is carried forward throughout the book. For myself, I can reflect on entering education to create positive change for the students involved, largely in part because my past educational experience held many negatives. I have met others who entered the profession for similar reasons, falling inline with the idea of challenging the system from within. Hern expresses a similar thought, \"I have some genuine sympathy for the work-with-what-we-have point; at the same time, it is indicative of the ass-backwards way we tend to think of learning\" (2003, p. 55). I can't help but find a semblance of agreement as Hern explains how educators adapt to the system, or as Freire puts it, \"changing the consciousness of the oppressed, not the situation which oppresses them; for the more the oppressed can be led to adapt to the situation, the more easily they can be dominated\" (2003, p. 74).

I can't help but find a semblance of agreement as Hern explains how educators adapt to the system, or as Freire puts it, \"changing the consciousness of the oppressed, not the situation which oppresses them; for the more the oppressed can be led to adapt to the situation, the more easily they can be dominated\" (2003, p. 74).","title":"Reflection 2"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5360/2021-09-07-reflection-2/#resources","text":"Hern, M.

When I began a reply, I was reflecting on a conference presentation at the Chicago Humanities Festival, Beyond the Binary.

It's hard to pick a point in time to begin the story of my college experience. Perhaps it's best to start by framing myself as a non-traditional college student... For one, I did not graduate high-school, I was fully independent, and I was navigating the workforce the best a 18-year-old can. But it is there, in the workforce, that an adult first encouraged me to consider college as an option. Their words went something like, you are young... consider college as an option, else you may find yourself here - like me - working the same job I've been doing for my lifetime with little opportunity. I knew of this persons daily struggles, as they were a friend of those I was living with at the time. Of course those aren't their exact words, but for whatever reason they sparked an interest into college. At this time in my life, I was living in the isolated landscape in the mountains of Colorado. I was not living with my parents and had not been for many years. I was living with a friend's family, actually I bounced between friends, and without them I would have been homeless. But, this one household was my primary and where I applied to college. At this time, there was a requirement for ACT/SAT scores as well as a High-School Diploma to enter college. So, simple enough, mark in-progress for High School and register to take the ACT exam. I was learning how to complete this from my friend, who was being supported through one of their parents and advisors, I didn't have such support. On the eve of the ACT test is when my story has an interesting plot point. As most students have test anxiety before the exam, mine became exponential that night. As in the midnight hours, a domestic violent situation occurred in the house - this was actually the norm for my living environment. But what made this event unique, is on this evening my friend and I where chased from the house by a person yielding a shotgun. Yep, a shotgun pointed at us! We ran and we where chased... where shots fired, I suspect yes. I don't recall where we slept that night, perhaps in the woods, and yet somehow we made it to the school for the ACT testing in the morning. Once the testing begun, I put my head down, wept, and feel asleep. Needless to say my scores were not high; however they were low enough to allow me to enter college, at Metro State. From my understanding this is due to a \"bell-curve\" measure for admittance from the ACT scores, allowing a percent of students on either end, both high and low... I believe it may have been tied to affirmative action in someway, just a guess. So cool, I'm admitted to college! As time moves forward, I left that living situation and relocated; and earned my High School Equivalency and applied for Financial Aid. As a side note, it turns out I found myself in another abusive household and eventually leads me to starting college homeless. But I digress and will pick up on that later and want to point to catch in Financial Aid. The catch being, even though I was independent from my parents, I was still financially tied to them until the age of 24. This is further complicated because one of my parents earned enough money to significantly contribute to my education, therefore I was denied all financial help. The one parent who could contribute, refused - for whatever reason - while the other had no means to support. I was actually encouraged by my parent's abusive spouse to drop out and take on labor/factory work (put my head down, earn a paycheck and live for retirement, or something like that)... Okay, I'll admit, this timeline is messy and probably not linear at this point... but when I was beginning college, I was bouncing in and out of abusive households, and always on the verge of homelessness or homeless. But I had the desire to learn... to prove to myself that I could... something my earlier experiences in education tried to squash out of me. It was during my first year in college that I had to learn to self-advocate for academic support. I found myself far below the literacy/numeracy level needed. I was also in a culture shift, in a setting that I imagined to be relatable to high-school - it was foreign to me. I struggled... attending classes and driving an hour for full time employment. At some point in my first year, I was homeless... living out of my car I purchased for $500 when I was around 19 or 20 (this was my first car). One thing I'm reminded of whenever I try to recall my past, there was little consistency in my life... creating complex timelines to keep track of... and holds true when I began college. I ended up donating my car when it began having maintenance issues, then putting insurance and maintenance costs towards rent in Denver. I was able to take public transit to my job, but eventually quit because of the hour commute turned to a 3-hour commute through public transit. I found employment locally, but nothing anyone would consider sustainable. I paid for my tuition out of pocket (paychecks), but I primarily paid for tuition using credit cards, as they were allowed to market to college students on campus at the time - pretty sure this is no longer allowed (predatory lending). However, without credit, I may have not been able to pay for tuition. I also kept local work, and eventually discovered \"work-study\" employment, I think I was eligible for this regardless of parent financial support or perhaps this happened when I was 24? But whenever it did happen, I remember being the one who was offered to take home food from meetings, and after events - no shame, they just knew I needed it. I have a friend who reminded me recently of the one-day I showed up to their house with boxes upon boxes of pizza - all left over from an athletic event - and how I left them enough to feed themselves for a month... I'm sure I did the same. As time went on, I was reliant on numerous food banks, handouts, and end of day throw aways - yay dumpster diving! The grocery store was a luxury. As for housing, I eventually ended up living in cooperative housing... which grew to 12+ roommates who where majority students - and we supported each other in housing costs and food. We actually became a part of a larger community network of others doing the same and it was a very positive experience, creating community and friendships. The point being, how to keep housing and have food was always a thought while in school. By the end of my undergrad, I was able to afford housing and food on my own... this is primarily due to that I was subsidized by financial aid - yay student loans! I'm still paying them off to this day, under an income driven payment plan. Unfortunately, my financial struggles did not end after I graduated. Post graduation, I have had to rely on food banks as my primary food source at several points; sometimes while even working full-time - wages have not kept up with the cost of living at all. I have found myself long-term unemployed three times now - I think - each no fault of my own and all within the field of education. One lay-off even effected my first Masters program, which had a requirement of full-time employment and that was not available during The Great Recession. Even worse, it seems each time I reenter the workforce the wages offered to me have been less then the one I was laid off at... working backwards if you will, in position and wage. With all that said, my past experience is mine and it is rich in experience and perspective. I often share my vulnerable experiences with students and colleagues, especially during my last employment working in Adult Basic Education. Many of the students I worked with come from similar/relatable backgrounds. Sharing academic and life struggles can be powerful and uniting... they can become reflective and actionable. Update 2021-09-23 \u00b6 Thought of another interesting plot point... While I was homeless and living in the streets of Denver, I was sleeping somewhere near civic center station - which used to have an above ground park. It was there, that my high-school Art teacher recognized me. It was the only room in the building that I ever walked into, and one of the only people (teacher) who ever noticed and encouraged me. I remember we spoke shortly and at the end they said they would submit a letter of recommendation to Metro State. I'm not sure if I was already accepted, or still applying, but whatever they said in their letter of recommendation exempted me from a full-year of Fine Art prerequisites, giving me a jump start on a Fine Arts degree. I later switched degree paths, but that one teacher encouraged and supported me in a chance encounter.","title":"A personal reflection: My college experience"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-5360/2021-09-22-reflection/#a-personal-reflection-my-college-experience","text":"This is a story I've shared numerous times and each time edited differently...

It was one of the first Little Schools or Free Schools to appear in Denmark, a country with a long tradition of sponsoring alternatives to the public school system.

How to improve mental health at school. KQED MindShift. https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/58404/how-to-improve-mental-health-at-school This article looks at students' mental health in the wake of COVID-19. The narrative is based on students in the San Francisco Bay area, and identified middle/high school students are experiencing different anxieties. Younger students are fearful about general safety and whether they are in contact with peers often enough; whereas, high school age students are concerned with family security and are taking on \u201cadult\u201d roles, i.e. childcare and entering the workforce. Solutions are offered for educators to better support students and are detailed through the article. Solutions include (a) creating positive school culture; (b) building strong relationships with students, parents and caregivers; and (c) creating a space for flexible communication.

HigherEdJobs Advice & News. https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=2811 In celebration of Women\u2019s Equality Day, HigherEdJobs posted an article examining the impacts that the pandemic has had on women in higher education and the current progress higher education has had in creating an equitable workplace. In addressing the effect of the pandemic, women across the globe were disproportionately impacted, both in lay-offs and the ability to return to workplaces. As far as equity in higher education, it is stated, \u201cwomen make up more than half of the U.S. workforce and they receive the majority of university degrees at virtually every level\u201d and yet make up 32% of leadership in higher education. The wage gap continues for women in higher education as well, noting \u201cwhile 60 percent of higher education professionals are female, only 24 percent of the industry's top earners are women; 2.5 percent of them women of color. On the other hand, 76 percent of top earners are males.\u201d The article covers some of the institution's reasoning for the persistence of these disparities and offers a few solutions - including building supportive pipelines (mentoring).

Interestingly, this did not correlate to delinquency experiences. However, LBGTQA/GNC youth are overrepresented in the justice system, estimated at 12-20% while being 5-8% of youth overall. These numbers were stated to be \u201cconsistent across races, contrary to a popular assumption that most queer youth are white.\u201d The study reveals disparities in lived experiences between LBGTQA/GNC and Straight/Non-GNC, both inside and outside of juvenile detention. The study also probed into practices of correction officers, in general and trauma informed. It was concluded the corrections officers may have the desire to employ trauma informed practice but may be lacking the skill, expertise, or training. There is no mandate to follow trauma informed practices. The study loosely concludes that cumulative trauma experienced by LBGTQA/GNC youth may have an impact on entry into the justice system.

Sending science majors into elementary schools helps Latino and Black students realize scientists can look like them. HigherEdJobs Advice & News. https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=2733 STEM educators in Los Angeles wanted to see if they could engage their student population and have them view themselves as future scientists. It is noted that across seven schools, grades two to five, \u201cover 80% of the students are Latino, and about 13% are African American.\u201d Total students 2,400. They conducted a simple study called \u201cdraw-a-scientist-test.\u201d They had students complete this before and after the STEM instruction - which consisted of 20 hours of instruction over a year. What they noticed was small but significant increases of the diversity in the drawings of scientists. The drawings \u201cdemonstrate that the students are developing and internalizing an identity of becoming a scientist.\u201d Miller, S. (2021, August 31).

The report is geographically aligned to those in Europe and the US. It probes not only what can be done in learning environments, but also makes recommendations to educational technologists and policy makers. Part 2 of the report details the history and challenges of social emotional learning and inclusive education across the defined geographical areas. Part 4 covers a framework (index) for social emotional learning and inclusion that includes three dimensions (a) intrapersonal development, (b) interpersonal development, and (c) professional training. Part 5 pulls the research together into recommendations for educators, educational technologists, and policy makers. Payne, R. K. (2013). A framework for understanding poverty: A cognitive approach (5th rev. ed.) [E-book]. Aha! Process, Inc. A popular framework but not without criticism for lack of evidence, use of stereotypes, and not addressing systemic issues related to gender, race, ethnicity, etc. Interestingly, these criticisms are addressed in Appendix C. The framework examines how social class impacts peoples lives and offers instructional strategies to support those who have experienced poverty. It is asserted that to move out of poverty, it takes more than material gains, i.e. it requires a behavioral and cognitive shift. In essence, a person can be monetarily wealthy but still hold on to a mindset of poverty. Some topics explored within the framework include relationships, hidden rules, and emotional responses/resources.

Community-based responses to justice-involved young adults. U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice. https://permanent.fdlp.gov/gpo83079/248900.pdf The purpose of this report is to raise questions concerning the criminal justice system and young adults (18-24). Historical context of the juvenile court system is first established, taking a stance that \u201cyoung adults today are in far more need of support \u2014 for education and employment, for example \u2014 to successfully enter adulthood than they were 40 years ago (not to mention 116 years ago, when the juvenile court was founded).\u201d The report makes an argument for why young adults are a distinct population that require new considerations, and are separate from juveniles and adults. This is formed from a multidisciplinary understanding, including neurobiology. To further support the claim, they analyze changing demographic information from 1960-2012. Graphs are presented showing females/males out of school and not working by race and ethnicity, and ratio of black to white male imprisonment. The findings are summarized as \u201cthese levels of demographic disconnectedness and the increasing need for higher education to compete meaningfully in the labor market add to the neurobiological findings, compounding the challenges for this age cohort.\u201d The report then proposes reforms to the justice system looking beyond just the court\u2019s functions, but also to \u201cto promote public safety, better life outcomes, greater social integration and more fairness.\u201d Techstars. (2021, April 25). 5 questions with Aaron Clark, Founder of Justice Reskill. Techstars The Line. https://www.techstars.com/the-line/5-questions/aaron-clark-founder-of-justice-reskill Aaron Clark is the founder of an organization (Justice Reskill) within Techstars - a foundation to support local startups - who is participating in the Accelerate Equity program. Justice Reskill utilizes equity as their \u201cNorth Star\u201d and recognizes that systemic injustices, specifically in the criminal justice system, has deeply affected the community and has disproportionately impacted the lives of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Justice Reskill takes a different approach to education, one that supports the whole learner, offering opportunity and wrap-around support for individuals touched by the justice system. In the interview, Aaron shared a story of how the program supported a learner, with a child, to relocate to safe housing while they were facing certain homelessness. Vaswani, N., & Paul, S.

The Howard Journal of Crime and Justice, 58(4), 513\u2013534. https://doi.org/10.1111/hojo.12344 This study raises the question about the ability to implement trauma informed practice in a corrections setting. It is noted, \u201cthere is currently no research that specifically explores the role, implementation, and impact of such practice within the prison context.\u201d Ideas that pertain to trauma informed practice for the study are clearly summarized before expanding into the correctional setting. Many personal narratives drive the analysis forward, specifically in the opportunities and challenges sections. It concludes that implementing trauma informed practice in a \u201cprison context is problematic\u201d as the environment is complex and punitive. The shortcomings of the study are also acknowledged, as the study group focuses on \u201cyoung males in custody, and values and practices may differ with other groups, such as females, or adult males.\u201d Vencill, J.

The study specifically looked at participants in mixed orientation relationships and found moderate or above levels of depression (34.5%), anxiety (25.4%), and stress (27.3%). Additionaly, a US survey found that there is a lack of a positive attitude toward bisexual individuals, including lesbian and gay individuals - \u201cbinegativity results in bisexual individuals experiencing minority stressors \u2018from all sides,\u2019 including from other sexual minorities.\u201d It was noted that bisexual individuals are believed to be the single largest sexual minority group in the United States and this study discusses the unique minority stressors for this group. Yalom, V., & Yalom, M. H. (2010, April). Peter Levine on trauma healing: A somatic approach. Psychotherapy. https://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/interview-peter-levine This is an interview with Peter Levine discussing trauma and somatic treatment. The interview uses patient examples to inform the readers of types of trauma and how it expresses itself, detailing the effects in a person's life. Stories shared include panic attacks, PTSD and C-PTSD. Connections are made, throughout, to the three modes of response to threats and stress (a) tonic immobility, (b) fight-or-flight, and (c) social engagement system. Trauma can cause these systems of response not function correctly, hence expressions of trauma. Takeaway \u00b6 When considering social justice and education, I found an abundance of resources. I believe there were 300 published on DE&I in the last month alone - Auraria Library search. After scanning the research amongst these prominent topics, I gained a fuller picture of the landscape. I see each of the topics as being interconnected and may inform how we create environments that support the full human experience.

The full presentation revolves around ideas of relationships, community, and not taking away the humanity of each other. Kast, D. J. (2021, June 4). Sending science majors into elementary schools helps Latino and Black students realize scientists can look like them. HigherEdJobs Advice & News. https://www.higheredjobs.com/Articles/articleDisplay.cfm?ID=2733 STEM educators in Los Angeles wanted to see if they could engage their student population and have them view themselves as future scientists. It is noted that across seven schools, grades two to five, \u201cover 80% of the students are Latino, and about 13% are African American.\u201d Total students 2,400. They conducted a simple study called \u201cdraw-a-scientist-test.\u201d They had students complete this before and after the STEM instruction - which consisted of 20 hours of instruction over a year. What they noticed was small but significant increases of the diversity in the drawings of scientists. The drawings \u201cdemonstrate that the students are developing and internalizing an identity of becoming a scientist.\u201d Miller, S. (2021, August 31).

Index for social emotional technologies: Challenging approaches to inclusive education (1st ed.). Routledge. https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351185073 This is a research based report examining the intersection of educational technologies and social emotional learning, with inclusion at the front and center. The report is geographically aligned to those in Europe and the US. It probes not only what can be done in learning environments, but also makes recommendations to educational technologists and policy makers. Part 2 of the report details the history and challenges of social emotional learning and inclusive education across the defined geographical areas. Part 4 covers a framework (index) for social emotional learning and inclusion that includes three dimensions (a) intrapersonal development, (b) interpersonal development, and (c) professional training. Part 5 pulls the research together into recommendations for educators, educational technologists, and policy makers. Payne, R. K. (2013). A framework for understanding poverty: A cognitive approach (5th rev. ed.) [E-book]. Aha! Process, Inc. A popular framework but not without criticism for lack of evidence, use of stereotypes, and not addressing systemic issues related to gender, race, ethnicity, etc. Interestingly, these criticisms are addressed in Appendix C. The framework examines how social class impacts peoples lives and offers instructional strategies to support those who have experienced poverty. It is asserted that to move out of poverty, it takes more than material gains, i.e. it requires a behavioral and cognitive shift. In essence, a person can be monetarily wealthy but still hold on to a mindset of poverty. Some topics explored within the framework include relationships, hidden rules, and emotional responses/resources.

Community-based responses to justice-involved young adults. U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice. https://permanent.fdlp.gov/gpo83079/248900.pdf The purpose of this report is to raise questions concerning the criminal justice system and young adults (18-24). Historical context of the juvenile court system is first established, taking a stance that \u201cyoung adults today are in far more need of support \u2014 for education and employment, for example \u2014 to successfully enter adulthood than they were 40 years ago (not to mention 116 years ago, when the juvenile court was founded).\u201d The report makes an argument for why young adults are a distinct population that require new considerations, and are separate from juveniles and adults. This is formed from a multidisciplinary understanding, including neurobiology. To further support the claim, they analyze changing demographic information from 1960-2012. Graphs are presented showing females/males out of school and not working by race and ethnicity, and ratio of black to white male imprisonment. The findings are summarized as \u201cthese levels of demographic disconnectedness and the increasing need for higher education to compete meaningfully in the labor market add to the neurobiological findings, compounding the challenges for this age cohort.\u201d The report then proposes reforms to the justice system looking beyond just the court\u2019s functions, but also to \u201cto promote public safety, better life outcomes, greater social integration and more fairness.\u201d Techstars.

Techstars The Line. https://www.techstars.com/the-line/5-questions/aaron-clark-founder-of-justice-reskill Aaron Clark is the founder of an organization (Justice Reskill) within Techstars - a foundation to support local startups - who is participating in the Accelerate Equity program. Justice Reskill utilizes equity as their \u201cNorth Star\u201d and recognizes that systemic injustices, specifically in the criminal justice system, has deeply affected the community and has disproportionately impacted the lives of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Justice Reskill takes a different approach to education, one that supports the whole learner, offering opportunity and wrap-around support for individuals touched by the justice system. In the interview, Aaron shared a story of how the program supported a learner, with a child, to relocate to safe housing while they were facing certain homelessness. Vaswani, N., & Paul, S.

The Howard Journal of Crime and Justice, 58(4), 513\u2013534. https://doi.org/10.1111/hojo.12344 This study raises the question about the ability to implement trauma informed practice in a corrections setting. It is noted, \u201cthere is currently no research that specifically explores the role, implementation, and impact of such practice within the prison context.\u201d Ideas that pertain to trauma informed practice for the study are clearly summarized before expanding into the correctional setting. Many personal narratives drive the analysis forward, specifically in the opportunities and challenges sections. It concludes that implementing trauma informed practice in a \u201cprison context is problematic\u201d as the environment is complex and punitive. The shortcomings of the study are also acknowledged, as the study group focuses on \u201cyoung males in custody, and values and practices may differ with other groups, such as females, or adult males.\u201d Vencill, J.

The study specifically looked at participants in mixed orientation relationships and found moderate or above levels of depression (34.5%), anxiety (25.4%), and stress (27.3%). Additionaly, a US survey found that there is a lack of a positive attitude toward bisexual individuals, including lesbian and gay individuals - \u201cbinegativity results in bisexual individuals experiencing minority stressors \u2018from all sides,\u2019 including from other sexual minorities.\u201d It was noted that bisexual individuals are believed to be the single largest sexual minority group in the United States and this study discusses the unique minority stressors for this group.

Currently, sex and sexual orientation is not openly discussed in education, while legislation is actively casting shadows on the subject. The inability to openly discuss sex and sexual orientations has a negative impact on the LGBTQ+ community, but may also generally effect the United States\u2019 perceptions of sex and sexual orientations. When considering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), as well as Trauma Informed Practices in education and workplaces, there may be a need to understand minority stresses and the relationship to mental health. In this study, researchers Jennifer A. Vencill, Samantha Carlon, Alex Iantaffi, and Michael Miner seek to expand the empirical literature concerning bisexual mental health; a population high in numbers but under represented in research (2017). Since few studies currently exist, the researchers did not enter a hypothesis, since no prior studies were known at the time, but did set parameters for inquiry. Synopsis \u00b6 Empirical literature surrounding bisexual mental health, relationships, and sex is under represented in sexual health reasearch. Previous research primarily surrounds HIV/AIDS and sexualy transmitted infections (STIs), leaving a gap in liturature concerning bisexual experiences, specifically experiences concerning mental health. It was noted, that individuals identifying as bisexual are the single greatest sexual minority, comprised of an estimated four million people in the United States. The study consisted of a small population (53) self-identitfying as bisexual recruited through flyers at local gathering spots and through social media. Participants were additionally required to be in a mixed orientation relationship, i.e. with partners not identifying as bisexual. This information was collected as part of the prescreening process utilizing a Qualtrics survey before moving to the quantitative portion of the study. The study utilized several qualitative measures, each are considered to have high-reliability scales. Measures included, Bisexual Identity Index (BII), Daily Heterosexist Experiences Questionaire (DHEQ), Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionaire (CSFQ-14), New Sexual Satisfaction Scale (NSSS), Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). The minority stress framework was cited as consistently supporting \"the link between sexual orientation-related minority stressors and negative mental health outcomes\" (Vencill et al., 2017, The present study, para. 2). Three minority stress variables were selected as possible mediators \u2014 mechanisms or processes \u2014 between mental health and relationship outcomes: (1) Isolation, inability to find meaningful relationships within the LBGTQ community and others; (2) Vigilance, the effects of anti-LBGTQ attitudes/behaviors; and (3) Vicarious Trauma, learning of lived experiences surrounding LGBTQ predjudice and discrimination. It was concluded that Isolation and Vicarious Truama were significant mediating variables connecting bisexual identites and mental health. Where Isolation mediated depression (50%), anxiety (31%), and stress (26%), while Vicarious Trauma mediated identity affirmation and anxiety (82%). To note, Vicarious Trauma includes \"anti-LGBTQ slurs, jokes, discrimination, or hate crimes\" (Vencill et al., 2017, Discussion, para. 3). Additionally, it was discussed that the population is affected by a unique minority stressor, binegativity, which affects the mental health and relationships for bisexual identifying individuals. The study concluded that \"bisexual individuals need to be connected to support and resources that specifically affirm their sexual orientation\" (Vencill et al., 2017, Discussion, para. 3). Strengths \u00b6 Concise explanations of each measure/scale were provided, as well as a sample question from measure/scale that participants answered. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge the limitations of their study and made suggestions for further research into the issue. Limitations included, acknowledging the lack of diversity (identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomics) of the participants. Even with the limitations of study, the conclusions reached are significant in the larger context of the purpose for the study, expanding sexual health literature pertaining to bisexuals and mental health. Critique \u00b6 As noted in the strengths section, and acknowledge by the authors, expanding the literature on the health for those identifying as bisexual is much needed. For a sexual minority group estimated to include four million, a sample size of fifty-three seems inadequate; however the findings are supported by a larger research base surrounding individuals identifying as lesbian or gay. The authors also disclosed that the selection criteria may have faults, perpetuating binegativity and bisexual stereotypes, which coincidently are minority stressors for those participating. Conflicts of interest were also disclosed in the study. Best Uses \u00b6 In thinking about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, as well as Trauma Informed Practices, it is relevant to understand minority stressors that affect the mental health of others. Beyond mental health, understanding how others are perceived in the world and how those perceptions affect them adds a layer of empathy to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Moving forward, looking more into the minority stress framework may provide support, understanding, and insight. References \u00b6 Vencill, J. A., Carlson, S., Iantaffi, A., & Miner, M. (2017).

I worked in K12, Middle & High Schools, and as Special Education Instructor in a youth facility for runaway, abused, and justice-involved youth (Family Tree). In 2010, I found myself in the niche arena of Adult Basic Education & Family Literacy \u2013 instructing, designing curriculum, and managing programs. This was through the Community College of Denver and community partner organizations: (1) Mi Casa Resource Center, (2) The Gathering Place, (3) Denver Indian Center, and (4) Denver Housing Authority. One of my final projects while at the Community College of Denver was designing and developing a distance learning program meeting state partner (Colorado Department of Education) requirements. This program was rapidly expanded in 2020 when all programming went online, and I became the lead trainer to bring seven instructors and 200+ students into it. It was successful and we shared the model out to other programs during the transition. Currently, I\u2019m presiding over Colorado\u2019s Adult Basic Education support, resource, and advocacy group, CAEPA, in a volunteer capacity. A year ago, in August 2020, I began the Learning Design and Technology Master\u2019s program when funding cuts left me unemployed. I initially applied to several positions within the Community College System, but was lacking a Master\u2019s which was required for many of the positions. So, as my last program's grant funding came to an end, I redirected my attention towards personal development. I am graduating this year, in December 2021. With graduation around the corner, I\u2019m searching to get back to mission driven employment and preferably back into employment within Higher Education. I have been applying to job announcements while completing the program, but I have not had any employers take notice. In completing this career inquiry, my purpose is to look at job announcements in a different light and uncover requirements that may have been overlooked while submitting previous applications. Literature Review \u00b6 Marissa Arnquist (2020) conducted six open-ended interviews with individuals employed in eLearning and completed a job search for the purpose of defining the skills and competencies required to enter the field. During background research, Arnquist discovered the field is varied, and still evolving with a lack of consistent naming conventions. Arnquist discovered a lack-of eLearning specific articles and defaulted to Technical Communications for the literature review. Arnquist identified ten top skill competencies in the literature review and later refined these to current job market demands in the study: (1) Instructional design, (2) Interpersonal skills, (3) Project / Time management, (4) Writing, (5) Quick learner, (6) Assessment / analytics, (7) Visual design. Arnquist spent time defining key skills, such as interpersonal communication, empathy, curiosity, as well as additional skills, project management, visual design, strategy, and pedagogy. Pedagogy was referenced many times as being overlooked or misunderstood by the interviewees, with some stating qualities of importance but ultimately lumped pedagogy into design models, i.e. ADDIE. Arnquist also outlined common tools, team dynamics, and points of frustration found in the field, as well as the many titles these professionals carry. Xie et al. (2021) conducted eight interviews with iInstructional dDesigners working within higher education across the midwest of the United States. The study utilized nine questions and were developed using strengths, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis. The purpose of the study was to determine how emergency remote teaching, due to the pandemic, changed the roles and responsibilities of iInstructional dDesigners. Xie et al. found that initially during the transition instructional designers were engaging in technical support in-order to build relationships and connections with teaching faculty. To reach a broader audience blogs were created to support the transition, as well as recording professional development for teaching faculty with topics including: (1) migrating instructional materials, (2) media production, (3) strategies for video conferencing, and (4) guidance in scaling back assignments. Instructional designers noted they saw a pedagogical shift from the teaching faculty, away from lecture based styles to engaging with students through more frequent communication and discussions, personal stories, and showing empathy. The interviewees have hopes that because of the emergency remote teaching that instructional designers\u2019 roles and responsibilities would become more defined, more respected as a professional, and seen more as a resource and support for teaching faculty. Methodology \u00b6 Utilizing HigherEdJobs.com a job search was conducted utilizing an advanced search. Job announcements were filtered by one criteria, job category. The category selected was \u201cAdmin - Instructional Technology and Design\u201d as it was noted during a keyword search for \u201cInstructional Designer\u201d that all announcements were grouped under this category. The remaining advanced search options were left as default. Options included position type (full/part time), institution type (four-year, two-year, outside higher education), and location type (location bound, remote). The defaults included the widest possible search, including all options, and revealed 431 job announcements with a variety of titles and entry levels. To refine the search, \u201cColorado\u201d was defined as the location revealing seven job announcements. Colorado was selected as the state has a law requiring job announcements to include the rate of pay. With the job announcements refined a spreadsheet was created utilizing a new line for each position title. Headings were initially created with the constants within the job announcements: (A) Position title, (B) Institution, (C) Location, (D) Pay rate (low), (E) Pay rate (high), (F) Education (required), and (G) Education (preferred). To determine the skills and competencies both the minimum and preferred requirements would be considered and broadly coded into categories, where \u201c1\u201d equals \u201cyes\u201d and a \u201c0\u201d equals no/undefined. For example, \u201cExperience supporting and administering a learning management system, preferably Canvas\u201d (Colorado School of Mines, 2021), would be coded as LMS support equals 1. Based on the first job announcement viewed, these categories included (H) Higher Ed experience, (I) Previous experience, (J) Technical support, (K) LMS support, and (L) ID models. New columns were added as job announcements expanded the categories, to include: (M) Media design, (N) Programming, (O) Evaluating data, (P) Accessibility, (Q) OER, (R) Specialized. The final column, Specialized, refers to job announcement specific qualifications, such as grant management or Wordpress plugins. To see the complete data set, view the spreadsheet data . Findings \u00b6 From the seven job announcements in Colorado, the evaluation includes only five as two of the announcements were for part-time temporary library support roles, paying an hourly rate. Of the five remaining job announcements, the job titles varied but \u201cInstructional Technologist\u201d was most commonly referred to. Each job announcement requires a Bachelor's degree, however all prefer a Master\u2019s degree; the degree is sometimes specified, but also includes a catch all phrase of related. The aggregate pay rate for the positions in the dataset averaged $54,680 (low) and $65,350 (high), see chart 1. Chart 1: Pay rate, low and high Each position requires previous experience working in higher education settings, with two not defining length of experience, two requiring two-years experience, and one having a sliding scale of one- to two-years depending on education level. All require technical and learning management support, which aligns to the findings in Xie et al. (2021). For a full list of required and preferred skills, see chart 2. Chart 2: Required and preferred skills As the job announcement requirements move beyond technical support, learning management support, and knowledge of instructional design models and theories, they become increasingly more specific to the needs of the institution. Media design is vaguely described as demonstrated experience, or additionally with a list of authoring tools (Colorado State University-Pueblo, 2021; Front Range Community College, 2021). Programming can be defined as experience with HTML, CSS; but may also include scripting languages and API knowledge (Colorado School of Mines, 2021; Front Range Community College, 2021). Reflection \u00b6 It\u2019s interesting to see how sparse or densely descriptive each job announcement can be. The more descriptive announcements tended to be special initiatives put forth by the institution and explained in detail the initiative and need for the position. It\u2019s also interesting to see how specialized a position description can be; such as Lamar Community College is looking for \u201cIREPO\u201d Grant Director / Instructional Designer - a dual position - or how Front Range Community College has the most comprehensive requirements, and yet offers the lowest salary. Since both of these institutions are community colleges, it might speak to the resources these institutions have available. The most surprising requirement is that all the job announcements require former work experience in higher education; this requirement may be a barrier to those that otherwise might be a viable candidate for the position. It is also interesting to see that only two of the five institutions listed knowledge and use of accessibility guidelines as a requirement. References \u00b6 Arnquist, M. (2020).

I worked in K12, Middle & High Schools, and as Special Education Instructor in a youth facility for runaway, abused, and justice-involved youth (Family Tree). In 2010, I found myself in the niche arena of Adult Basic Education & Family Literacy \u2013 instructing, designing curriculum, and managing programs. This was through the Community College of Denver and community partner organizations: (1) Mi Casa Resource Center, (2) The Gathering Place, (3) Denver Indian Center, and (4) Denver Housing Authority. One of my final projects while at the Community College of Denver was designing and developing a distance learning program meeting state partner (Colorado Department of Education) requirements. This program was rapidly expanded in 2020 when all programming went online, and I became the lead trainer to bring seven instructors and 200+ students into it. It was successful and we shared the model out to other programs during the transition. Currently, I\u2019m presiding over Colorado\u2019s Adult Basic Education support, resource, and advocacy group, CAEPA, in a volunteer capacity. A year ago, in August 2020, I began the Learning Design and Technology Master\u2019s program when funding cuts left me unemployed. I initially applied to several positions within the Community College System, but was lacking a Master\u2019s which was required for many of the positions. So, as my last program's grant funding came to an end, I redirected my attention towards personal development. I am graduating this year, in December 2021. With graduation around the corner, I\u2019m searching to get back to mission driven employment and preferably back into employment within Higher Education. I have been applying to job announcements while completing the program, but I have not had any employers take notice. In completing this career inquiry, my purpose is to look at job announcements in a different light and uncover requirements that may have been overlooked while submitting previous applications.","title":"Career Inquiry"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-6720/2021-10-02-project-1/#literature-review","text":"Marissa Arnquist (2020) conducted six open-ended interviews with individuals employed in eLearning and completed a job search for the purpose of defining the skills and competencies required to enter the field. During background research, Arnquist discovered the field is varied, and still evolving with a lack of consistent naming conventions. Arnquist discovered a lack-of eLearning specific articles and defaulted to Technical Communications for the literature review. Arnquist identified ten top skill competencies in the literature review and later refined these to current job market demands in the study: (1) Instructional design, (2) Interpersonal skills, (3) Project / Time management, (4) Writing, (5) Quick learner, (6) Assessment / analytics, (7) Visual design. Arnquist spent time defining key skills, such as interpersonal communication, empathy, curiosity, as well as additional skills, project management, visual design, strategy, and pedagogy. Pedagogy was referenced many times as being overlooked or misunderstood by the interviewees, with some stating qualities of importance but ultimately lumped pedagogy into design models, i.e. ADDIE. Arnquist also outlined common tools, team dynamics, and points of frustration found in the field, as well as the many titles these professionals carry. Xie et al. (2021) conducted eight interviews with iInstructional dDesigners working within higher education across the midwest of the United States. The study utilized nine questions and were developed using strengths, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis. The purpose of the study was to determine how emergency remote teaching, due to the pandemic, changed the roles and responsibilities of iInstructional dDesigners. Xie et al. found that initially during the transition instructional designers were engaging in technical support in-order to build relationships and connections with teaching faculty. To reach a broader audience blogs were created to support the transition, as well as recording professional development for teaching faculty with topics including: (1) migrating instructional materials, (2) media production, (3) strategies for video conferencing, and (4) guidance in scaling back assignments. Instructional designers noted they saw a pedagogical shift from the teaching faculty, away from lecture based styles to engaging with students through more frequent communication and discussions, personal stories, and showing empathy. The interviewees have hopes that because of the emergency remote teaching that instructional designers\u2019 roles and responsibilities would become more defined, more respected as a professional, and seen more as a resource and support for teaching faculty.","title":"Literature Review"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-6720/2021-10-02-project-1/#methodology","text":"Utilizing HigherEdJobs.com a job search was conducted utilizing an advanced search. Job announcements were filtered by one criteria, job category. The category selected was \u201cAdmin - Instructional Technology and Design\u201d as it was noted during a keyword search for \u201cInstructional Designer\u201d that all announcements were grouped under this category. The remaining advanced search options were left as default. Options included position type (full/part time), institution type (four-year, two-year, outside higher education), and location type (location bound, remote). The defaults included the widest possible search, including all options, and revealed 431 job announcements with a variety of titles and entry levels. To refine the search, \u201cColorado\u201d was defined as the location revealing seven job announcements. Colorado was selected as the state has a law requiring job announcements to include the rate of pay. With the job announcements refined a spreadsheet was created utilizing a new line for each position title. Headings were initially created with the constants within the job announcements: (A) Position title, (B) Institution, (C) Location, (D) Pay rate (low), (E) Pay rate (high), (F) Education (required), and (G) Education (preferred). To determine the skills and competencies both the minimum and preferred requirements would be considered and broadly coded into categories, where \u201c1\u201d equals \u201cyes\u201d and a \u201c0\u201d equals no/undefined. For example, \u201cExperience supporting and administering a learning management system, preferably Canvas\u201d (Colorado School of Mines, 2021), would be coded as LMS support equals 1. Based on the first job announcement viewed, these categories included (H) Higher Ed experience, (I) Previous experience, (J) Technical support, (K) LMS support, and (L) ID models. New columns were added as job announcements expanded the categories, to include: (M) Media design, (N) Programming, (O) Evaluating data, (P) Accessibility, (Q) OER, (R) Specialized. The final column, Specialized, refers to job announcement specific qualifications, such as grant management or Wordpress plugins.

Of the five remaining job announcements, the job titles varied but \u201cInstructional Technologist\u201d was most commonly referred to. Each job announcement requires a Bachelor's degree, however all prefer a Master\u2019s degree; the degree is sometimes specified, but also includes a catch all phrase of related. The aggregate pay rate for the positions in the dataset averaged $54,680 (low) and $65,350 (high), see chart 1. Chart 1: Pay rate, low and high Each position requires previous experience working in higher education settings, with two not defining length of experience, two requiring two-years experience, and one having a sliding scale of one- to two-years depending on education level.

Chart 2: Required and preferred skills As the job announcement requirements move beyond technical support, learning management support, and knowledge of instructional design models and theories, they become increasingly more specific to the needs of the institution.

It\u2019s also interesting to see how specialized a position description can be; such as Lamar Community College is looking for \u201cIREPO\u201d Grant Director / Instructional Designer - a dual position - or how Front Range Community College has the most comprehensive requirements, and yet offers the lowest salary. Since both of these institutions are community colleges, it might speak to the resources these institutions have available. The most surprising requirement is that all the job announcements require former work experience in higher education; this requirement may be a barrier to those that otherwise might be a viable candidate for the position. It is also interesting to see that only two of the five institutions listed knowledge and use of accessibility guidelines as a requirement.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"Digital-Pedagogy/INTE-6720/2021-10-02-project-1/#references","text":"Arnquist, M.

It seems as if the two were bound to meet, after all, aren\u2019t educators leaders? Plus, it is my thought that dialogue and praxis (reflection and action) both lend themselves to leadership; add in a praxis rooted in critical pedagogy, then social justice would be at the forefront. My key question \u00b6 How does critical pedagogy extend to leadership? Jump to Resources , Additional Resources Search Method \u00b6 Research was initially conducted utilizing a search engine, DuckDuckGo, using the keywords \u201ccritical leadership critical pedagogy\u201d. This surprisingly brought up relevant journal articles and a few websites on the first page; these top hits were saved into a notes file for review. Three of the top results originated from the https://eric.ed.gov database. While reviewing the articles found in ERIC, I also searched within the database for \u201ccritical leadership\u201d. This additional journal articles to the surface to skim. When following the direct links out of the ERIC database, I also conducted a search within the originating sources search bar using only \u201ccritical leadership\u201d. What I found is there are many articles on the topic, spanning across regions, disciplines, and organizations. Skimming the articles also highlighted new search terms to further inquiry; such as:, transformative leadership, critical reflective leadership, and distributed leadership. Takeaway \u00b6 Taking a step back and critically examining leadership was a bit energizing and empowering, finding that it is essential to question the characteristics, attributes, abilities, roles, and structures that are traditionally called leadership. Collinson (2011) pulled back the curtain and questioned many of these. Moving through the resources, I found that critical leadership is multifaceted and may take many forms; such as, applied critical leadership, critical reflective leadership, culturally responsive leadership. They all have a common link; they are each transformative leadership based in critical pedagogy. Resources \u00b6 Aho, R. E., & Quaye, S. J. (2018).

Journal of Critical Scholarship on Higher Education and Student Affairs, 3(3), 8\u201319. https://ecommons.luc.edu/jcshesa/vol3/iss3/2/ Summary: This article takes a hard-stance, stating that the U.S. Hhigher Eeducation has embedded imperialistic tendencies which are perpetuating the harmful effects of colonization rooted in racism. As a resolution, the authors outline and discuss the application of critical leadership at professional organization level through the American College Personnel Association (ACPA). It is the view of the authors that professional associations have the responsibility and ability to transform spaces, in that they provide direction, guidance, and leadership to the field. They organize the article through three sections: (1) work of the ACPA, (2) theoretical frameworks for applying critical leadership, and (3) future scholarship and practice for those implementing. In the first section, the strategic imperative for the organization is defined and it is explained why it is necessary to not only call for racial justice, but also the inclusive need to call for decolonization. In part two, applied critical leadership is discussed utilizing a theoretical framework presented by Santamar\u00eda & Santamar\u00eda, incorporating transformational leadership, critical pedagogy, critical race theory, and tribal critical race theory. The closing section points to some critiques, but is a call to action; it reminds the reader that professional associations hold the opportunity to forward this discussion. Collinson, D. L. (2011).

The chapter abstract caught my eye; with the description of organization hierarchy that is all too familiar, in that leaders are above those who they are leading. In other words, those below follow orders and are not in a two-way communication with the leader - in essence anti-critical pedagogy. Furthermore, the chapter counters mainstream thoughts of leadership, listing them as societal qualities held or developed by the leader and examines these critically. Collinson, organizes the discussion of leadership into four themes which surfaced through research, (1) essentialism, romanticism, and dualism, (2) control and resistance, (3) dissent and consent, (4) men and women. In each theme, mainstream thought is challenged with critical inquiry raising awareness and questions. The chapter serves as an introduction to critical leadership studies and outlines reasons why leadership needs to be viewed from a more critical point of view, stepping outside of societal constructs.

Australian Journal of Teacher Education, 37(4). https://doi.org/10.14221/ajte.2012v37n4.5 Summary: Written through a human (natural) narrative, Cunningham tells the story of her principalship and doctoral studies utilizing Critical Reflective Practices (CRP) which transformed to Critical Reflective Leadership (CRL). In the intro, Cunningham did not shy away about why she was hired to fill the vacancy in a South American elite high school; in reflection she reasoned, being Australian, white, and spoke English as a first-language all added to being short-listed for the position, - on par with other hires. This opens the door to critically look at the world, building an understanding of the social and political context of the school, while striving to hold on to her social justice ideals. Cunningham walks through the CRP handbook she selected \u2014 Smyth, J., and McInerney, P. et al., (eds) (1999). Critical Reflection on Teaching and Learning. Investigation Series/Teachers' Learning Project \u2014 and then details the why and how it was modified to accommodate the change in position, from teacher to principal. This followed the CRP four step process: (1) describing, (2) informing, (3) confronting, and (4) reconstructing. Cunningham\u2019s modifications largely had to do with time, both hours in a day and time passing for meaningful reflection in a complex leadership position. As she explains each of the modifications, the reader gains insight to injustices Cunningham becamewas becoming aware of, and addressesaddressing through modifying CRP to CRL. In the conclusion, Cunningham stated that this practice was invaluable in high-stakes decision making, but it also came with conflict and critique. Afterall, Cunnigham was ultimately documenting and challenging school governance practices. Santamar\u00eda, L. J., & Santamar\u00eda, A. P. (2015).

International Journal of Multicultural Education, 17(1), 22\u201341. https://doi.org/10.18251/ijme.v17i1.1013 Summary: This article is contributing to the research extending leadership for diversity, social justice, and equity. Santamar\u00eda & Santamar\u00eda offer a divergent view from the stated often binary and compartmentalized ways in which academic research is traditionally presented. The stated purpose originates from observations of emergent new ways of leading, and they seek to make these leadership practices seen. The article is organized into three sections; (1) relevant literature, (2) comparative case studies, and (3) comparative findings. The case studies include 20 educational leaders, with localities in both the United States and New Zealand, who all identify as people of color. These locations were observed to promote social justice and have potential to affect the global educational landscape. The discussion of educational leadership is framed as distinctly separate from management, and the authors are posing educational leadership as crucial to global human development; diversity is an opportunity for education. Santamar\u00eda & Santamar\u00eda define Applied Critical Leadership (ACL) as harnessing both professional and embodied lived experiences with theoretical foundations in transformative leadership, critical pedagogy, and critical race theory. These theoretical underpinnings serve to expose underlying assumptions concealing inequitable power relations and practices. In an example of missed opportunity, M\u0101ori leadership roles are juxtaposed with ACL characteristics of leadership as evidence that voices may have been absent from educational decision making. These leadership characteristics are further discussed through combined case study narratives, combined to secure the anonymity of those participating. Concluding, the need to embrace intersectionality in leadership practices is an observed necessity. Wink, J., Kyles, C., & L. G., P. (2003, February 14).

International Journal of Multicultural Education, 17(1), 22\u201341. https://doi.org/10.18251/ijme.v17i1.1013 Summary: This article is contributing to the research extending leadership for diversity, social justice, and equity. Santamar\u00eda & Santamar\u00eda offer a divergent view from the stated often binary and compartmentalized ways in which academic research is traditionally presented. The stated purpose originates from observations of emergent new ways of leading, and they seek to make these leadership practices seen. The article is organized into three sections; (1) relevant literature, (2) comparative case studies, and (3) comparative findings. The case studies include 20 educational leaders, with localities in both the United States and New Zealand, who all identify as people of color. These locations were observed to promote social justice and have potential to affect the global educational landscape. The discussion of educational leadership is framed as distinctly separate from management, and the authors are posing educational leadership as crucial to global human development; diversity is an opportunity for education. Santamar\u00eda & Santamar\u00eda define Applied Critical Leadership (ACL) as harnessing both professional and embodied lived experiences with theoretical foundations in transformative leadership, critical pedagogy, and critical race theory. These theoretical underpinnings serve to expose underlying assumptions concealing inequitable power relations and practices. In an example of missed opportunity, M\u0101ori leadership roles are juxtaposed with ACL characteristics of leadership as evidence that voices may have been absent from educational decision making. These leadership characteristics are further discussed through combined case study narratives, combined to secure the anonymity of those participating. Concluding, the need to embrace intersectionality in leadership practices is an observed necessity. Wink, J., Kyles, C., & L. G., P. (2003, February 14).

The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association (CAEPA) is an organization whose purpose is to support Adult Education programs within Colorado. It serves a diverse group of adult education programs such as community colleges, literacy programs, community initiatives, correctional programs, and nonprofits. CAEPA serves these programs through professional development, providing and sharing instructional resources, and advocacy for adult education. CAEPA is facing many obstacles in the way of Colorado\u2019s Adult Education. Some identified obstacles include: Adult Education programs suffer due to under-funding and resources, educators not being equipped with the skills of standards-based instruction, as well as, online/hybrid instructional and engagement strategies. The purpose of this design document is to create and develop a Colorado Ambassador Leaders program. The Colorado Ambassador Leaders program will provide professional learning around instructional strategies and foster professional learning communities. Additionally, the program will develop teacher and student ambassadors for Adult Education advocacy. The Ambassador Leaders program will serve as a stepping stone for the sustainability and growth of Adult Education programs in Colorado. Background \u00b6 As of this year, over half of Colorado\u2019s Adult Education programs have been defunded (federal at a state decision) leaving over 4,500 Coloradans who had programs, without a program. Colorado has identified 321,000 Adults lacking basic skills to advance in the workplace, and 126,000 Adults lacking basic English skills to advance (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020a). All in Federal and State, an adult learner is supported by $838 compared to $10,000 in elementary education (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020a). Funding \u00b6 In 2014, Colorado was the last state in the union to receive state funding and has one of the lowest state contributions of one-million dollars (Wilson, 2014). Colorado Adult Education is funded through two-streams of grant funding. One at the Federal level is called Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) \u2014 which lasts for 4-years. The other is State funding called, Adult Education and Literacy Act (AELA) \u2014 which lasts for 3-years. Both grants are distributed through the Department of Education, Office of Adult Education Initiatives. Colorado Senate Bill (SB20-009, 2020) was successfully advocated for in 2014 and again in 2020. The 2014 passage marked the year that Colorado began funding Adult Education. The following revision was signed into law on July 8, 2020, and provides an expansion of service providers and at the same funding level. Student Ambassadors \u00b6 CAEPA is witnessing a decline in their Professional Development attendance and low involvement in advocacy campaigns, including Student Ambassadors. CAEPA has participated in the Coalition on Adult Basic Education Student Ambassador campaigns for about 2 years (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020b) and has had little buy-in from the field. COABE has recently hired a part-time coordinator for its Student Ambassador program. However, their focus is on recruitment and preparation for civic engagement with elected officials. COABE does prepare all talking points at the Federal level and provides advocacy materials. They recently released an app that connects participants by regional areas. Professional Learning \u00b6 The Colorado State Office of Adult Education Initiatives (AEI) has provided little professional development to the field. The Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE) who administers the Federal funds has issued the Department of Education a Corrective Action Plan ( Appendix B ). In the plan, they made several recommendations for AEI, noting their lack of leadership and lack of professional development for the field. In recent years, CAEPA has fulfilled the majority of the states required professional development, AEI noted this in their required FY Narrative Reports to OCTAE (National Reporting System, n.d.). Since the pandemic, AEI has provided links to distance learning platforms, however, this came around June/July of 2020 and was in conjunction with the office of K-12 (Colorado Department of Education, n.d.). They provided no guidance, limited training, and provided no practices to support educators during this time of transition. As an example of poor guidance, AEI suggested proctoring the federally mandated standardized test to adult learners in their cars in empty parking lots, rather than provide training to implement online testing. However, AEI does have an online platform that has a Q&A forum with resources, and last checked is poorly maintained. To support Colorado\u2019s Adult Education professional development needs, CAEPA hosts an annual PD Conference every October. Over the years a decline in attendance has been tracked (Table 1). Table 1: Conferences ( Appendix A ) Year 2016 2017 (2018) 2018 2019 Registered 258 159 176 98 Summary of Analysis \u00b6 The learners we are targeting for this project are those who serve as adult educators. CAEPA describes those they serve as \u201cadult education and family literacy programs from across Colorado that are diverse in nature: local community and faith-based organizations, community colleges, school districts, corrections facilities, workforce districts and libraries\u201d (Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, n.d.). With so many diverse contexts being represented, the experience levels of adult educators greatly vary. To assess problems and gaps across our wide spectrum of learners, we conducted several needs assessments, including, two-personal virtual interviews and a broad survey distributed to the adult education field at large. We also meet with stakeholders virtually, including, CAEPA Board of Directors and one of their affiliates, Literacy Coalition of Colorado \u2014 representatives present, from the Literacy Coalition, included District Libraries and volunteer teacher coordinator. After conducting the multiple needs assessments, we analyzed each data group and the data as a whole. During the analysis, we discovered the entire field of Adult Education had similar problems and gaps; however, there was no singular emphasis of common need. We were able to organize these emerging patterns into six broad groups of problems and gaps ( Appendix C ). When identifying possible solutions, we were able to filter these groups down to three interconnected needs to address ( Proposed Learning Solution ). Virtual Interviews \u00b6 We utilized methods found in Kouprie, M., & Visser, F. S. (2009). A framework for empathy in design, as a base for developing Learner Personas ( Appendix D , Appendix E ). These were created to aid in better understanding the needs of our learners. Both learning personas represent distinct stakeholders in the Ambassador Leaders program. These learner personas allowed us as instructional designers to discover our learners, immerse ourselves in their reality, connect to their reality, and detach to use our new knowledge for instruction development. Summary of Learner Persona 1 \u00b6 Kelly is an example of a target learner in the formal adult education field. She has thirteen years of experience in adult education administration roles. Those thirteen years have been in various contexts such as government, non-profits, and higher education. In a previous role in Arizona, Kelly had prior experiences with the national Student Ambassador program. She values how it promotes awareness of Adult Education within the community, gives a personal face to the work, and advocates for increased funding for Adult Education. Kelly desires programs like Student Ambassadors to become more prevalent in Colorado. She believes that more professional development and the creation of a learning community for facilitators. Kelly\u2019s perspective helped guide our decisions on the design plan. Her positive reactions to the National Student Ambassador program and desire to see it more prevalent in Colorado assured us that developing an Ambassador Leaders program would be well received. Kelly does not individually have the knowledge to create a curriculum to implement an advocacy program. This allows for our learning solution to include curriculum and professional learning to facilitate an advocacy program. She also does not have the knowledge of other adult educators in Colorado desiring to implement a Student Ambassador program. Kelly needs an in-person or online forum to connect and collaborate with other facilitators as a professional learning community. Summary of Learner Persona 2 \u00b6 Nadine holds an Elementary education teaching license (K-6) and currently is employed with the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) where she has spent 5 years instructing adult education classes. Nadine\u2019s prior experience includes 3 years of teaching adult education for non-profit organizations and has 2 years of experience in elementary education. Nadine has a personal desire to learn to use modern web applications and to improve their instructional abilities through improved lesson design. As the CDOC is placing more emphasis on standards-based instruction, as well as career and technical education, these changes also become a learning opportunity for Nadine. She expressed this transition has added pressure and receives little support internally. When designing the solution, we considered how we could support both of Nadine\u2019s desires, professional learning in instructional skills, and a supportive professional community. We also considered Nadine\u2019s limiting environment, CDOC, for a Student Ambassador program. With these considerations, the emphasis would need to be placed on professional learning that included professional support from their peers, with less focus on student ambassadors. Adult Educator Survey \u00b6 We also surveyed the field of adult educators in Colorado connected to CAEPA ( Appendix F ). We inquired about the field\u2019s workplace, familiarity with adult education associations, as well as their familiarity with Student Ambassador, and interest in participating. We also asked the field of their highest training needs personally and within their program. The following are major takeaways from the Adult Education Survey: Background \u00b6 The median experience level of respondents is 11.5 years with workplace contexts including community colleges, corrections, nonprofits, and other (publisher, self-employed, library services, community services). Roughly two-thirds of respondents are adult education instructors. The remaining one-third identified as instructional trainers and program directors. It\u2019s evenly split by thirds, where respondents are currently working: in-person, hybrid, or remote/online. The majority are using online learning in some capacity. Adult Education Associations \u00b6 Respondents are more familiar with their State (CAEPA) and National (COABE) Association than their Regional (MPAEA) Association. Student Ambassadors \u00b6 Familiarity with the National Student Ambassador program is generally low. Almost half of the respondents are not interested in more information on the program. A quarter of respondents were unsure if they wanted more information. This shows an overall negative response to the National Student Ambassador program. The overwhelmingly negative reaction towards the program led us to consider a name change for our program. The following question asked about professional development needs for Student Ambassadors and the respondents\u2019 reflect the previously seen interest level. However, the need for structure and support is consistently expressed. Professional Learning \u00b6 When asked about their personal professional learning needs, respondents\u2019 expressed a desire for a large variety of professional development topics but the common theme surrounded effective remote learning. This will guide the content of microlearning experiences to have a focus on remote learning strategies. This will guide the content of microlearning experiences to have a focus on remote learning strategies. When asked about professional learning for their program, respondents\u2019 needs mirror the need for remote learning but added a clear need for learner community development. A portion of the microlearning experience will be collaborative in nature. It will connect adult educators and not only provide learning, but also a community. Additional Stakeholders \u00b6 Internal and external stakeholders had valuable input regarding the value of Ambassador Leaders to the learners and how the program could impact decision making at the Colorado Department of Education, Office of Adult Education. After meeting with external stakeholders, the idea of tiered professional development came to mind. Their concern was with great diversity, comes diverse learning needs. This idea of tiered professional learning will benefit the programs in many ways. We see tiered training as a way to increase learner engagement by allowing learners to enter and build their skills over time, allowing for meaningful learning. When designing the goal for the program, we wanted to instill a common thread for all professional learning. After meeting with the organization, we accepted their proposed change from \u201cbest practices\u201d to \u201chigh impact practices\u201d. This change places a degree of research and moves the training to student-centered. Instructional Design Model \u00b6 For this design solution, we are applying various design models, including: ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) Design Thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) Human-Centered Design (Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation) However, we are utilizing the ADDIE model as our instructional design backbone, Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate. We chose the ADDIE model as it is a well-known and industry-recognized model. It was our hope, in keeping with the familiar, that we could help stakeholders better understand our departures into new models (eLearning Industry, 2020). Early on, we felt our learning design needed to address the human element, as our identified gaps included learner detachment. To do so we incorporated Design Thinking with the mindset of Human-Centered Design (HCD). Design thinking is a 5-step process that would overlay Human-Centered design thinking. Human-Centered Design utilizes two modes of thinking, convergent and divergent. When designing a learning experience, both modes of thinking place the learner at the center. Convergent thinking is logical and seeks to answer questions. While divergent thinking seeks to create ideas by asking new questions. By combining Design Thinking \u2014 which places the learner at the center of the design process \u2014 and Human-Centered Design, we ended up with the model shown in Figure 1: Using Human-Centered Design with Design Thinking (MovingWorlds, 2018). To break down our design process, we will summarize our steps through the context of the ADDIE model. When additional instructional design models are used, we will note actions taken in each ADDIE phase. As additional instructional design models may not be one-to-one inline with ADDIE, best efforts will be taken to correlate their relationships. Figure 1: Using Human-Centered Design with Design Thinking Analysis \u00b6 Design Thinking: Empathize (Learner Personas) Design Thinking: Define (Problems Gaps, Goals, Objectives) HCD: Inspiration (Interviews, Survey) As we entered the analysis phase, we needed to better understand our learners and their knowledge gaps; therefore, we expanded ADDIE\u2019s analysis phase to incorporate additional instructional design models to better connect with our learners. We conducted interviews, and surveyed the field of adult education, providing us with a human connection. Through utilizing Human-Centered Design techniques early on, we discovered problems and gaps that might have gone unnoticed. One such example is the solution name itself, Student Ambassadors. While reviewing the survey results, it turns out over half of the adult educators have negative connotations with a program by that name. We also discovered the name to be a point of confusion during the interview process, since the solution design is targeting adult educators, not students. To correct this newly discovered problem, we adjusted the solution design name to Ambassador Leaders. The name is ambiguous to allow any participant to be recognized as a leader. Developing learner personas illuminated the complexity and diversity of our learners. It also helped us to define the knowledge and skills gaps that our students need to have met. Design \u00b6 Design Thinking: Define & Ideate (Objectives, Assessment, Journey map) HCD: Ideation (Journey map) During this iterative process, we reflected on our learning goal and our identified problems and learning gaps and proceeded to create learning objectives. During the same time, we also brought in a human element and started to structure a learning path through our proposed learning solution. Considering the wide array of learning gaps and problems uncovered during our analysis, we attempted to design a solution that would be adaptable while meeting the organization\u2019s initial needs. It was here that we expanded the ADDIE design phase to include Design Thinking. While using the Design Thinking model, we iterated between the Define and Ideate phase allowing us to create a fuller more robust solution, than what might have been possible. Mixing this with a Human-Centered Design mindset, we spent time considering the impacts of the solution for both the learner and the organization ( Appendix G ). Based on the problems and learning gaps we identified in the Analysis phase, learning objectives were revised during the design phase to better align with the desired outcomes for the Ambassador Leaders program. During this revision, appropriate objective-aligned assessments were designed. A primary outcome for the Ambassador Leaders program looks to support Colorado Adult Educators through building a professional learning community while also engaging the field in advocacy efforts. A challenge in the advocacy effort is the competing National Student Ambassadors program which was found to have negative connotations. We designed around this problem, through a name change, in the analysis phase and considered this important factor while planning the learners\u2019 journey. Through an outreach campaign, we decided we could build learner awareness of the program goals and professional learning opportunities. We also realized outreach would support the need for transparency and reporting successes of an advocacy program desired by the field. We, therefore, placed it at multiple points in the program design creating a circular process, solving multiple needs through thoughtful communication with the field. With low Adult Educator professional development opportunities available in Colorado, providing meaningful professional development was a natural next step. With the diversity of professional learning needs in the field, we had to design a flexible learning environment, which also respected the learner\u2019s busy schedules. We thought of the idea of courses structured around microlearning experiences would best address this need. We then dove-tailed the courses with forums to build a professional learning community, a need consistently expressed by our learners. Therefore, the collaborative peer forum will be used to facilitate community and communication. Without a behavior change, professional learning makes no difference. Therefore, once the direct instruction and collaborative process have been completed, learners must go out into their contexts and implement their new knowledge and strategies. Finally, the long-term successes of learners implementing their newly gained knowledge will be celebrated. This will be documented and used to spread awareness of the Ambassador Leader program and advocate for Colorado Adult Education, leading back to the initial need. Develop \u00b6 Design Thinking: Ideate & Prototype (Storyboard) HCD: Ideation & Implementation (Storyboard) Within the development phase, we focused on a microlearning experience. We practiced the use of storyboarding and thought about the human element of how learners would progress through professional learning. Development of the program microlearning experiences will be driven by the specific learning objectives created during the Design phase and tied initially to the professional learning identified in the Adult Educator Survey. We storyboarded a course exemplifying a leveled course structure building from a base idea to the program goal of implementing high-impact practices into instruction ( Appendix H ). This will be a format for course development. As we have provided a high-level objective for professional learning, additional learning objectives will be embedded in the microlearning courses to inform the learning within the courses. The microlearning courses and community forums are the heart of the Ambassador Leaders program and are the intended professional learning opportunities and professional community that will be continuously developed. Implement \u00b6 The implementation phase will be when learners participate in the learning experience. We have detailed a Beta cycle for implementation and guidelines are outlined in the Schedule. Within the schedule have laid out milestones and mapped out a timeline to implement a beta program cycle. This could be considered a test run using a minimal viable project (MVP) for the first iteration. Evaluate \u00b6 Blended New World Kirkpatrick Model Design Thinking: Define & Ideate (Objectives, Assessment, Journey map) HCD: Ideation (Journey map) During the iterative process of the design phase, we considered the high-level learning objectives for the Ambassador Leaders program, we also considered the assessment and evaluation for each phase. We have aligned the assessments to the New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM) in a blended assessment form. A blended model consists of multiple assessment strategies used to reach any one level of NWKM. The evaluation process was designed thinking about how each phase is a stepping stone to the next phase of learning, to lead the learner through the program. Evaluation data will be analyzed and used to refine the Ambassador Leader program. In analyzing the evaluation data, NWKM Level 1 will lead to Level 4. We have provided an evaluation schedule and plan for communication ( Evaluation Plan ). Proposed Learning Solution \u00b6 While considering the organization\u2019s initial needs and mission and after conducting a broad analysis of the intended learners, we are proposing a robust learning solution to meet the needs of the organization and the learners they support. The solution will be a program called Ambassador Leaders and will address three overarching learning needs in Colorado Adult Education. Development and support of Teacher & Student Ambassadors Offering professional learning for Colorado Adult Educators Fostering a supportive professional community The solution will be a comprehensive program leading the learners through four-phases of learning, each phase contains one- or two-objectives. Professional learning and community are the heart of the solution and are designed to be highly flexible and expandable over time to meet the changing needs of adult education (Figure 2: Ambassador Leaders). To best explain the learning solution, we will summarize the journey detailing the organization\u2019s involvement and the learners\u2019 journey ( Appendix G ). Figure 2: Ambassador Leaders Phase 1: Prepare \u00b6 During the first phase, the organization will be defining the program and explaining the opportunities contained within. This will be a marketing campaign aimed at recruiting participants and explaining the offerings that will be available during the next phase. Emphasis will be placed on (re) branding Ambassador Leaders \u2014 a program designed to support adult education through advocacy, professional learning, and a supportive network ( Appendix I ). This will be an ongoing campaign, with new announcements released as new content becomes available, always reaffirming the goal of the program. From the learners\u2019 perspective, they will discover the vision of the program and will connect to the familiar aspect of professional learning the organization is known to provide, generating enthusiasm. Additionally, the learner will also build an understanding of the inherent advocacy aspect. The learner will be able to distinguish how Ambassador Leaders is in juxtaposition to the larger national Student Ambassador model. The dropping of the adjective \u201cstudent\u201d is intentional. By labeling all participants as \u201cAmbassadors\u201d the program will empower adult educators and will include programs and by proxy, student voices too. The broader definition of Ambassador Leaders will create a larger more sustainable community of advocates representing the diversity in Colorado Adult Education. The conclusion of this phase will be when the learners register for the program. The primary goal of this phase is to inform the participants of the program\u2019s advocacy effort and professional learning available. Phase 2: Acquire Knowledge and Skills \u00b6 This phase is the heart of the program and can be imagined as a series of microlearning courses, offering synchronous and asynchronous learning through a learning management system. Initially, the organization will be the primary content creators, building the library of professional learning available. Later, Industry experts including publishers and speakers will be sought out as content creators, as well as, contributors from the field and external stakeholders. The content will have a consistent build as there will be guidance provided as to the structure of each course. Learning opportunities in this phase will have a subset of learning objectives to support the specific topic of instruction. Through the Adult Educator survey ( Appendix F ), immediate training needs have been identified \u2014 surrounding online instructional strategies \u2014 and will be prioritized in the Beta Release. All topics of instruction will incorporate the use of a high impact practice ( Appendix H ) to address the program goal. Basing the goal of the project on a flexible practice will string a common thread of learning throughout every offering in the Ambassador Leaders program while meeting the needs of the adult education field. The learners will have ongoing access to the various contents within the platform. These skills and knowledge will be built around unique learning objectives and assessments for the microlearning course and will be accessible in the learning management system. Over time, each course will offer different levels of understanding similar to a course structure, 101, 201, 301, etc\u2026 By offering levels of content, or tiers, we are connecting to the learners\u2019 intrinsic motivation by offering choice and meeting the learner where their skill level is at and honoring the diversity of the adult educators we serve \u2013 Adult Learning Theory. Phase 3: Build Memory and Apply on the Job \u00b6 Phase three of the solution intends to build a learner community and extend learning from the previous phase. This phase contains two-steps, one within the learning management system and the other externally in their workplace, respectively. The first step will have the learners collaborate with other professionals within forums or in virtual breakout sessions. This will be a safe place to explore new ideas the learner picked up in the previous phase. Learner Persona 2 (Appendix 1) noted that their workplace environment is lacking in a supportive space to exchange and explore new instructional ideas, this step is designed to support this gap. Additionally, this space can provide discussions surrounding advocacy or other topics adult educators choose to start-up, informing future learning topics. The second step will ask the learner to apply the new skills on the job, with an emphasis on trialing high impact practices. Learners will be able to fall back to the previous collaborative step to ask questions, seek guidance, or report successes. From the organization perspective, the content creators will be fulfilling the role of moderators during the collaborative phase. Additionally, the organization will reach out to the learners to find out how things are going in their workplace. This will be a formative assessment and can be survey-based. The questions will be open-ended, with emphasis on reflection based answers, asking the learners about their experience in the Ambassador Leaders program this far and how they are applying the new information. By providing learners a safe place to exchange ideas and asking for reflections about the impacts of new practices within their workplace, the Ambassador Leaders program will meet the learning objectives for this phase. Phase 4: Maintain Use Over Time \u00b6 To wrap up the program, we wanted to further connect the learners and outreach to new potential learners and content creators. This phase is about transparency, communication, and supporting the Ambassador Leaders program. As part of the design, we wanted to recognize the work of Adult Educators. This could be considered a capstone project for the learners, representing a high impact practice. The organization will follow up with how the learner is applying the ideas gained through participating in Ambassador Leaders. This is in response to a critique we heard during our interview with Learner Persona 1 ( Appendix D ). They expressed a desire to know how other programs are implementing ambassador ideas, their struggles, and their successes. During this phase, the organization will conduct interviews \u2013 student, educator, or program \u2013 and release it to the public, thus restarting the program phases. Instructional Objectives \u00b6 Ambassador Leaders\u2019 instructional objectives are at a high-level, measuring the effectiveness of each phase of the learners\u2019 journey ( Appendix G ). We encompassed the learning solution using the full range of Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, following the hierarchical order forming the pyramid through each phase of the program. As the learner begins their journey, they will form the base of the pyramid and progressively move up the pyramid through the completion of each phase. Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy While designing each phase, we considered assessments and the instructional strategy to be used. As noted by Khalil, M. K., & Elkhider, I. A. (2016) there are three primary learning theories, behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructionism. We have identified the learning theory applied \u2014 informing instructional strategies to be applied \u2014 and the method to connect instruction and assessment, through each of the phases. As we have proposed a robust learning solution, additional learning objectives will be provided during Phase 2 & 3. These objectives will be tied to the individual microlearning lessons within the online courses and will be developed as courses are created. We have developed a course to demonstrate this ( Appendix J ). Solution Design Goal \u00b6 Through participation in Ambassador Leaders, Colorado adult educators will have reliably demonstrated the ability to use high impact practices and knowledge of advocacy strategies for the community, district, state, and national levels. Phase 1: Prepare \u00b6 These objectives are intended to be initially met through marketing materials and will take a behaviorist approach. Upon receipt of an announcement for professional learning, the new program will be outlined. When the learner engages and proceeds to register for the training, they will be asked retrieval based questions about new understandings about the Ambassador Leader program, as well as questions concerning types of professional learning they seek and details of their instructional contexts. Objective 1.1 \u00b6 Remembering (Knowledge): The learner will define what Ambassador Leaders are. Assessment: Multiple choice or short answer (retrieval based) Objective 1.2 \u00b6 Understanding (Comprehension): The learner will explain how the Ambassador Leaders model is an extension of the national adult education Student Ambassador model. Assessment: Compare and contrast short answer Phase 2: Acquire Knowledge and Skills \u00b6 These objectives will be met through the microlearning portion of the program\u2019s professional development. Applying the cognitivist learning theory, new information will be explained, demonstrated, or illustrated with the intent that the learner is actively participating in the instruction. Content leveling, or tiers, will further support the acquisition of new knowledge and is framed by the cognitivist learning theory (Ertmer, P. A., & Newby, T. J., 2013). Assessments will be conducted within the microlearning courses, aligning to each course\u2019s sub-objectives, and participant tracking will assess the program objective. Objective 2.1 \u00b6 Applying (Application): The learner will contribute to Ambassador Leaders through forums, training, and advocacy efforts. Assessment: Track learner engagement Objective 2.1.1 \u00b6 Microlearning course objectives Assessment will be embedded in the microlearning course Phase 3: Build Memory and Apply on the Job \u00b6 These objectives will be met through the collaborative exploration and application of the program\u2019s microlearning courses. Applying the theory of constructivism, \u201cLearners do not transfer knowledge from the external world into their memories; rather they build personal interpretations of the world based on individual experiences and interactions\u201d (Ertmer, P. A., & Newby, T. J., 2013). This phase will encourage learners to incorporate new strategies in their practices while building a supportive professional community. Assessments for objective 3.1 and 3.2 will include reflections. Reflecting first, during peer collaboration, on their experience in Ambassador Leaders and their professional learning. Then again, learners will reflect on what has changed in their practices based on their experience in Ambassador Leaders. Objective 3.1 \u00b6 Analyzing (Analysis): The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado\u2019s adult education programs, educators, and students. Assessment: Formative reflection surveys and feedback opportunities Objective 3.2 \u00b6 Evaluating (Evaluation): The learner will select appropriate high impact practices that promote student\u2019s skill-building, self-awareness, agency, and self-efficacy. Assessment: Summative reflection survey on practices before and after training. Phase 4: Maintain Use Over Time \u00b6 This objective will be met through the learners\u2019 long-term application of their professional learning. Continuing with the constructivist theory, learning is \u201cfacilitated by involvement in authentic tasks anchored in meaningful contexts\u201d (Ertmer, P. A., & Newby, T. J., 2013). A form of communication outreach will facilitate the assessment of this objective. It is intended to record successes in the field of Adult Education through various forms of media and publicly available \u2014 raising awareness and advocating. Objective 4.1 \u00b6 Creating (Synthesis): The learner will build safe and inclusive learning environments utilizing skills gained through Ambassador Leaders. Assessment: Document successes through media; i.e. interviews, program spotlights, student and educator interviews. Solution Storyboard \u00b6 The solution storyboard represents a learner\u2019s experience through a microlearning course within the Ambassador Leaders program ( Appendix J ). In the solution storyboard, we have provided an overview of the heart of the program and created a course containing four microlearning modules. Two of the four are detailed lessons, while the remaining two are present to demonstrate the progression of learning. Evaluation Plan \u00b6 The purpose of evaluating the Ambassador Leaders program is to determine the effect its implementation has on Adult Educators\u2019 instructional strategies and, ultimately, it\u2019s resulting in advocacy. With Colorado-based adult education\u2019s professional development lacking, the adult learners themselves are also suffering. The proposed Ambassador Leaders program will work towards rectifying this problem. This evaluation process will assess if the Ambassador Leaders program is meeting the high-level program outcomes of relevant professional development for adult educators and facilitate further development and refinement of the program. Data collection and analysis plan \u00b6 Data collected throughout the Ambassador Leaders program will be evaluated using the four levels of the New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM). Data will be collected through adult educator participation, learner self-reflection, post-learning feedback, and interviews. These results will be evaluated to improve the Ambassador Leaders program. Formative learner evaluations will take place throughout each phase, informing the effectiveness of the program. In the final program phase, a summative assessment will take place, asking the learners to demonstrate how they are implementing the instructional strategies they have discovered through the program. Evaluation schedule \u00b6 Evaluation and revision will occur once each Ambassador Leaders cycle is completed. Once completed, the collected data will be evaluated and analyzed to determine needed revisions to the next Ambassador Leaders cycle. New World Kirkpatrick Model \u00b6 Developed in the 1950s, the Kirkpatrick Model has become an industry standard for program evaluation. As professional learning has evolved, so has the model. It was revised last in 2016, taking on the name New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM) (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.). Level 4: Results \u00b6 \u201cThe degree to which targeted outcomes occur as a result of the training and the support and accountability package\u201d (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.). In the NWKM, Level 4 evaluates how professional learning impacts the organization and helps meet its mission and the program goal. This level of evaluation will utilize aggregated data through phases 3 & 4 and aim to assess learning outcomes of objectives 3.1, 3.2, and 4.1. Mission statement: The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, CAEPA, provides leadership to the field of adult education and family literacy by offering opportunities for professional development, advocacy, and resource sharing to improve the quality of life for every Coloradan (Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, n.d., Mission Statement). Ambassador Leaders goal: Through participation in Ambassador Leaders, Colorado adult educators will have reliably demonstrated the ability to use high impact practices and knowledge of advocacy strategies for the community, district, state, and national levels. Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado\u2019s adult education programs, educators, and students Objective 3.2: The learner will select appropriate high impact practices that promote student\u2019s skill-building, self-awareness, agency, and self-efficacy. Objective 4.1: The learner will build safe and inclusive learning environments utilizing skills gained through Ambassador Leaders. Level 3: Behavior \u00b6 \u201cThe degree to which participants apply what they learned during training when they are back on the job\u201d(The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.). A goal of the Ambassador Leaders professional development is for an instructional change. At the end of phase 3, learners will reflect on their work practices before and after the course. This will provide evaluation data on how their behaviors were affected by this experience. This contributes to the evaluation objective 3.2. During phase 4, a post-learning interview will be conducted. Learners are asked to share the changes they have implemented in their instruction based on their professional learning and share successes and struggles. This contributes to the evaluation objective 3.1 and 4.1 Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado\u2019s adult education programs, educators, and students Objective 3.2: The learner will select appropriate high impact practices that promote student\u2019s skill-building, self-awareness, agency, and self-efficacy. Objective 4.1: The learner will build safe and inclusive learning environments utilizing skills gained through Ambassador Leaders. Level 2: Learning \u00b6 \u201cThe degree to which participants acquire the intended knowledge, skills, attitude, confidence and commitment based on their participation in the training\u201d (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.). During phase 1, learners will gain knowledge about Ambassador Leaders and will be assessed through retrieval based questions during the registration process. This evaluates objectives 1.1 and 1.2. During phase 2, learners will gain knowledge on advocacy, instructional strategies, and high-impact strategies and will be assessed through a self-reflection of newly gained information within the microlearning course. This evaluates objective 2.1. During phase 3, learners will participate in a microlearning forum and be provided a learning reflection survey about the course, within the microlearning course. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 3.1. Objective 1.1: The learner will define what Ambassador Leaders are. Objective 1.2: The learner will explain how the Ambassador Leaders model is an extension of the national adult education Student Ambassador model. Objective 2.1: The learner will contribute to Ambassador Leaders through forums, training, and advocacy efforts. Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado\u2019s adult education programs, educators, and students Level 1: Reaction \u00b6 \u201cThe degree to which participants find the training favorable, engaging and relevant to their jobs\u201d (The New World Kirkpatrick Model, n.d.). During phase 1, reaction data will be collected through the results of enrollment and attendance of the Ambassador Leaders training. This will enable an analysis of the education context, experience, and personal learning goals of participants. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 2.1 and 3.1. During phase 2, the learners\u2019 reaction to the microlearning experience will also be gathered within the microlearning course. This data will help guide changes to future microlearning course opportunities. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 2.1. During phase 3, learners will be provided a course feedback questionnaire within the microlearning course. This contributes to the evaluation of objective 3.1. Objective 2.1: The learner will contribute to Ambassador Leaders through forums, training, and advocacy efforts. Objective 3.1: The learner will correlate how Ambassador Leaders support Colorado\u2019s adult education programs, educators, and students Plan for revision cycle \u00b6 Revision based on NWKM Level 1 data will be driven by the participation in Ambassador Leaders professional development opportunities. To determine low participation, we will compare the total who participated in an estimated total of adult educators, creating a ratio. Low participation will result in revision work of the CAEPA marketing and media campaign, as well as course content. Revisions for NWKM Level 2 will be based on course feedback. Data will be collected at the end of the microlearning course. If the course is determined to be ineffective or if learners share their LMS experience was not ideal, the course content will be adjusted accordingly. Revisions for NWKM Level 3 will be based on questionnaire feedback, forum participation, and learning application reflection. Based on results, adjustments will be made to course content, collaboration opportunities, and/or application opportunities. Revisions at level NWKM Level 4 is a culmination of all underpinning levels of evaluation, meeting the overall program goals and objectives. If these are not being met, then further analysis of the previously collected data will take place to guide revision. Plan for communication of results \u00b6 Communication of evaluation results will be shared at the organization\u2019s monthly board meeting. Raw data will be collected and shared a week in advance of the meeting so board members can review the data beforehand. Additional stakeholders may be invited to the meeting for additional input. Assumptions \u00b6 In several instances, we contacted the primary stakeholder, CAEPA, to confirm logistics before moving forward and surveyed the field. However, we still made assumptions concerning some factors. Organization level \u00b6 The Ambassador Leaders program would be a training supporting only Adult Educators and did not provide support for Adult Learners. CAEPA would be able to create course content based on the needs of Adult Educators. CAEPA would be able to recruit influential leaders, industry experts, and adult education vendors to support module development and provide potential keynotes. CAEPA would invite additional stakeholders into monthly board meetings for external feedback on the program. CAEPA would fulfill moderation of forums and perform assessment interviews. Learner level \u00b6 The learner will be willing to participate in post-learning interviews The learner will be able to implement new instructional strategies in their workspaces Learners will be active participants in the collaboration process and visit forums consecutively and in a timely manner If professional learning is available, adult educators will take advantage of the opportunity. Learners will have a device and a reliable internet connection Learners are willing to try new instructional strategies. Schedule \u00b6 For scheduling, we created a Beta Release timeline and designed program milestones. We then condensed this information into project milestones for a successful Beta Release. We also outlined a project timeline for the Beta Release, aligned to each phase of the program. Below you will find a list of project milestones followed by a project timeline surrounding the completion of each project phase. Project Timeline \u00b6 The dates listed are dates of completion and are suggested timeframes for completion of each phase of the Beta Release. Once the initial implementation is completed, the process will be iterated on, to improve future training. Design document completed December 06, 2020 Pre-release milestones December 31, 2020 Beta: Phase 1 January 31, 2021 Beta: Phase 2 February 15, 2021 Beta: Phase 3 February 15, 2021 Beta: Phase 4 February 28, 2021 Project Milestones \u00b6 We considered the project phases, steps, deliverables, and tasks to be completed, most outlined in our Journey Map (Appendix 1). After the completion of the design document, the pre-release milestones are to be completed before learners enter Phase 1 of the Beta Release. Pre-release \u00b6 Create an online learning platform, including a system to allow adult educators to register for the Ambassador Leaders program with embedded assessment questions. Develop course content addressing high priority learning needs and place within the learning management system with correlating course forums. Develop course formative and summative assessments Develop and release marketing materials for the field of adult education. Develop guidance for external content contributors for Ambassador Learning, including external stakeholders. Celebrate Pre-Release Completion! Beta Implementation \u00b6 Limited course offerings are available to the public and reflection surveys have been collected and reviewed for the next iteration. Invite external content creators to explore the platform and release content creation guidelines and invite submissions. Celebrate Beta Launch! Beta Evaluation \u00b6 Gather submissions of external content and complete course creation. Release success stories from Beta series and open registration. Celebrate Beta Conclusion! Iterate and Reset \u00b6 Analyze evaluation data Prioritize areas for iterations and adjust content/experience accordingly Communication Plan \u00b6 Communication will be open between CAEPA and the instructional designers. With milestone encapsulating deliverables and tasks, we, the designers, will be able to provide quick assistance, if needed, based on simple questions. Scheduled communication with CAEPA will take place on the third Monday of every month at the scheduled CAEPA board meeting through video conference. With project milestones set and a project timeline in place for a Beta Release, these will provide means of project tracking and guide our communication plan. Examples of such communication might include: How is the Pre-Release milestone coming along? Are you on track to meet the completion date? Process Summary \u00b6 After gathering data through interviewing and surveying stakeholders, we developed an understanding of the learning needs. We organized the needs to form a goal and objectives and iterated through a learner\u2019s journey to arrive at a workable solution. A solution for these needs was developed called the Ambassador Leaders program. Learner feedback will be used to iterate the Ambassador Leaders program to allow for growth and improvement. With effective implementation of the Ambassador Leaders program, Colorado Adult educators should have improved instructional practices, a professional learning community, and increased advocacy for adult education funding. Solution Summary \u00b6 Ambassador Leaders is a robust solution designed to support Colorado Adult Educators, through advocacy endeavors, professional learning opportunities, and the development of a professional community. Advocacy will come in multiple forms, from Teacher & Student Ambassadors to public policy. Professional learning opportunities through microlearning experiences will center around desired learning topics and applicable high-impact practices. Professional learning communities will be developed through collaborative opportunities in forums and sharing implementation experiences. Through Ambassador Leaders, Adult Educators will find increased support in Colorado. References \u00b6 Boller, S. (2018). Why You Need a Learning Journey Map.

AEFLA Funding: AEI initially released a timeline for the completion of the new AEFLA grant cycle and has not kept to it. The timeline has since been removed from the AEI Prospective Grantees page. The current grant competition is still underway as of October 2020. No determination of grantees has been announced. No funds have been released. AELA Funding: AELA Funding was uncertain as a revised AELA Bill was introduced into the State Legislature. AEI announced a no-cost continuation of AELA Funding in July 2020. This was after guidance for the programs to spend 100% of AELA Funds by July 31, 2020. CAEPA Rendezvous Attendance: Annual conference attendance has been steadily declining for the last 3 years, potentially connected to a lack of State Leadership. COVID-19 uncertainties: Planning for the annual conference would have started in November 2019 - but the above reasons pushed it to January 2020 - and then pandemic added new complexities to the decision making. Appendix B \u00b6 Corrective Action Plan CO Nov 2019 Monitoring Report 05-12-20 (Google PDF) Appendix C \u00b6 Problems & Learning Gaps Colorado adult educators have a mixed outlook, both positive and negative, of the national Student Ambassador model and are not aware of CAEPA\u2019s vision for the new program. Colorado adult educators are curious about the effectiveness of the national adult education Student Ambassador model in other states and if it impacts students\u2019 engagement with programs. Colorado adult educators are not equipped to integrate standards-based content instruction and contextualized learning strategies. Colorado adult education programs and staff are not proficient with online or hybrid instruction and assessment strategies or techniques. Colorado adult education programs and staff are unfamiliar with online or hybrid engagement techniques and are concerned about student performance in these learning models. Colorado adult education programs are unstable due to lack of funding and resources; some also suffer from unsupportive work environments. Appendix D \u00b6 Learner Persona 1 Program Segment: Community College System Discovery \u00b6 Kelly holds a Master\u2019s degree in Adult Education and Training. She has been working in adult education for 13 years. Those 13 years of experience consist of work in contexts such as government, non-profit, and higher education settings. All of these contexts were in an administration role, not a teaching role. Following a move from Arizona to Colorado Kelly is currently working as the director of Grant Development and Compliance at the Community College of Denver. Her professional goal is to ensure adult education remains funded in Colorado, especially for at-risk and diverse populations. She is motivated by the belief that individuals deserve the opportunity to flourish into their best self and for all people to have equitable education opportunities. Kelly is currently working from home due to the Covid-19 Pandemic making personal connections more challenging. Kelly has a general understanding of CAEPA as an organization that provides support to Adult Education in Colorado. She has a more comprehensive familiarity of the National Student Ambassador Programs from her previous work context in Arizona. Based on this previous experience, she is a supporter of Student Ambassador Programs because they help promote awareness of Adult Education within the community, provide powerful personal stories, and give students the opportunity to develop leadership and public speaking skills, especially when meeting with officials or other people in power. She also loves that Student Ambassador Programs give a personal face to the advocacy work that must be done frequently in adult education. Kelly is motivated to be proactive for the betterment of Colorado\u2019s adult education programs. Immersion \u00b6 Kelly is someone who would organize, create, and facilitate a Student Ambassador group in her context at the Community College of Denver. In her previous role in Arizona, she received Student Ambassador training. This training included preparing Student Ambassador facilitators to organize student advocacy efforts for additional funding through the state legislature for adult education and to put students\u2019 personal stories behind the need to fund this type of education. At a program level, she saw the advocacy efforts with the Student Ambassador Program result in added funding for adult education allowing for program expansion. With her experience working with Student Ambassadors, she saw participating students gain confidence, make connections, stay engaged in their program, and gain college and career readiness skills. She loves the Student Ambassador Program and is excited for them to become more prevalent in Colorado. Connection \u00b6 Kelly is currently not an active facilitator of a Student Ambassador Program due to the lack of their prevalence in Colorado. Although Kelly is passionate about the advocacy results of the Student Ambassador Program, she does not have the knowledge required to initiate a program. She does not know how to develop a curriculum that fosters the students\u2019 advocacy skills. To close this gap, Kelly needs a designed curriculum to implement or training on high-impact practices that will empower students. She also does not have the knowledge of other adult educators in Colorado desiring to implement a Student Ambassador program. Kelly needs an in-person or on-line forum to connect and collaborate with other facilitators as a professional learning community. Detachment \u00b6 When considering Kelly\u2019s desire to have increased advocacy for adult education, a need for a Colorado advocacy program. A pathway to this is explicit training on how to start and how to facilitate a Student Ambassador Program. Due to the nature of CAEPA providing aid for sites all around Colorado, this training will be best achieved through an online, module-based training. Module learning would include what the Student Ambassador Program is and its outcomes (supported by research), an example of an active and effective Student Ambassador Program, and a \u201cstarting-up\u201d protocol. Open communication between the program facilitators and the CAEPA Student Ambassador Leaders will be required. Advantages of this solution include the remote availability of training, the ability to have actionable steps presented, and combination of personal-connection and technology-based training. A main disadvantage of this solution is the lack of student-student interaction available within the learning experience. A consequence of this solution could be that some resulting Student Ambassador Programs may be started, but not upkept and maintained. Appendix E \u00b6 Learner Persona 2 Program Segment: Corrections Discovery \u00b6 Nadine was working as a case manager and job coach for formerly incarcerated men and women while earning their bachelors and master\u2019s degrees. They also obtained a Teacher License for Elementary Education (Grades: K-6); but soon after they felt a calling to return back to Adult Education. Nadine stated, \u201cAfter all, there is a generational problem; if the parents aren\u2019t doing well, the children aren\u2019t doing well.\u201d Nadine taught Adult Education classes at two non-profit agencies before transitioning into a corrections setting to teach Adult Education classes. They have experience teaching Adult Education classes for the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) and a College Preparatory curriculum for the Denver Women\u2019s Correctional Facility (DWCF). When Nadine was asked \u201cwhat is unique about your specific reality\u201d, they responded by stating, \u201cMy students are incarcerated\u2026\u201d Nadine continued to explain why their learners are incarcerated and the benefits that their instruction provides. Nadine identified a loss of conventional and effective learning opportunities in the learners\u2019 past as a common cause leading to the learners incarceration. It is their belief that through Adult Education classes their students not only obtain basic educational skills but also acquire self-esteem and confidence when they experience success in the classroom. Nadine see\u2019s these outcomes leading incarcerated learners to develop workplace skills and into career training which ultimately leads to meaningful employment and a decrease in the probability of returning to prison. Immersion \u00b6 Nadine has many roles within their organizational setting, and as such values their personal time. They expressed sheer joy at their new work schedules which now include 4 10-hour days. Nadine maintains a network of community agencies that provide services to help aid people reentering society, in addition to their direct instruction responsibilities. Currently, their classrooms are transitioning back to small in-person sessions on an alternating block schedule. To fully immerse into the CDOC, Nadine points to the organization\u2019s mission, which in part states, \u201cholding offenders accountable and engaging them in opportunities to make positive behavioral changes and become law-abiding, productive citizens.\u201d Again, Nadine expresses joy in the fact that the CDOC is moving from punitive practices to teaching, counseling, and guiding practices. Conversely, Nadine feels that the CDOC has an ingrained militaristic nature and a chain of command which adds frustration when new ideas are not heard or are outright ignored. Connection \u00b6 Nadine is a dedicated professional with a working knowledge of classroom technology that does not depend on the internet, which inmates are not allowed to access. This is a point of frustration which prevents Nadine from building new skills related to technology and inhibits their learner\u2019s from practicing and developing essential workplace skills. But like most educators, Nadine can be very innovative and makes the most of the equipment and supplies they do have. Nadine has a personal desire to learn to use modern web applications and to improve their instructional abilities through improved lesson design. As the CDOC is placing more emphasis on standards based instruction, as well as career and technical education, these changes also become a learning opportunity for Nadine. They expressed this transition has added pressure and they receive little support internally. Training needs extend beyond growth in skills and knowledge for Nadine and move into environmental problems. They encounter daily frustrations, internal conflicts, and work-place politics. All these can be daunting, demoralizing, and can affect their disposition in the classroom. It would be helpful to have training in areas of coping and self-care. Having worked in similar stressful environments, internal team building may also help improve this working environment. Detachment \u00b6 Moving forward with Student Ambassadors, Nadine would face an uphill battle. A new program not conforming to practice implemented by the chain of command may be a challenge. However, Nadine has a desire to learn new instructional strategies, is dedicated to serving their learners, and CDOC goals are shifting to better prepare student learners for reentry. This combination of alignments to Student Ambassadors may allow aspects of it to develop. We would need to ensure the learning objectives, included in our design, are clearly aligned to and support College and Career Readiness Standards in order to be successful in the CDOC. Additionally, we may consider incorporating Career Conversations, published by the American School Counselor Association, into the list of topics supported through the Student Ambassador program. This may help CDOC buy into the program through more explicit development of workplace related skills, in turn supporting Nadine. Nadine may best benefit from live training, allowing them to network in person with like minds, and may bring a breath of fresh air in comparison to their organizational environment. The downside to a live training is it may reduce access for other programs to participate, as this is a state-wide program. However, Nadine also has a desire to improve their personal digital literacy skills which could be supported through an online platform. Through virtual training, our design should contain an element of synchronous learning in order to best support Nadine. In designing for Nadine, I would see either learning solution benefiting them. When stepping back and considering learning objectives for the Student Ambassadors program, the learning solution needs to include instructional strategies and practices in order to support Nadine. We would also need to ensure those objectives help meet the overall Student Ambassador program goals. This would allow the Student Ambassador program to be flexible enough to support both programs and student learners, having the maximum impact and advocacy outreach.

The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association (CAEPA) is an organization whose purpose is to support Adult Education programs within Colorado. It serves a diverse group of adult education programs such as community colleges, literacy programs, community initiatives, correctional programs, and nonprofits. CAEPA serves these programs through professional development, providing and sharing instructional resources, and advocacy for adult education. CAEPA is facing many obstacles in the way of Colorado\u2019s Adult Education. Some identified obstacles include: Adult Education programs suffer due to under-funding and resources, educators not being equipped with the skills of standards-based instruction, as well as, online/hybrid instructional and engagement strategies. The purpose of this design document is to create and develop a Colorado Ambassador Leaders program. The Colorado Ambassador Leaders program will provide professional learning around instructional strategies and foster professional learning communities. Additionally, the program will develop teacher and student ambassadors for Adult Education advocacy. The Ambassador Leaders program will serve as a stepping stone for the sustainability and growth of Adult Education programs in Colorado.","title":"Project Overview"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5100/2020-12-06-design-document-ambassador-leaders/#background","text":"As of this year, over half of Colorado\u2019s Adult Education programs have been defunded (federal at a state decision) leaving over 4,500 Coloradans who had programs, without a program. Colorado has identified 321,000 Adults lacking basic skills to advance in the workplace, and 126,000 Adults lacking basic English skills to advance (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020a). All in Federal and State, an adult learner is supported by $838 compared to $10,000 in elementary education (Coalition on Adult Basic Education, 2020a).","title":"Background"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5100/2020-12-06-design-document-ambassador-leaders/#summary-of-analysis","text":"The learners we are targeting for this project are those who serve as adult educators. CAEPA describes those they serve as \u201cadult education and family literacy programs from across Colorado that are diverse in nature: local community and faith-based organizations, community colleges, school districts, corrections facilities, workforce districts and libraries\u201d (Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, n.d.). With so many diverse contexts being represented, the experience levels of adult educators greatly vary. To assess problems and gaps across our wide spectrum of learners, we conducted several needs assessments, including, two-personal virtual interviews and a broad survey distributed to the adult education field at large. We also meet with stakeholders virtually, including, CAEPA Board of Directors and one of their affiliates, Literacy Coalition of Colorado \u2014 representatives present, from the Literacy Coalition, included District Libraries and volunteer teacher coordinator. After conducting the multiple needs assessments, we analyzed each data group and the data as a whole. During the analysis, we discovered the entire field of Adult Education had similar problems and gaps; however, there was no singular emphasis of common need. We were able to organize these emerging patterns into six broad groups of problems and gaps ( Appendix C ). When identifying possible solutions, we were able to filter these groups down to three interconnected needs to address ( Proposed Learning Solution ).","title":"Summary of Analysis"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5100/2020-12-06-design-document-ambassador-leaders/#instructional-design-model","text":"For this design solution, we are applying various design models, including: ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) Design Thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) Human-Centered Design (Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation) However, we are utilizing the ADDIE model as our instructional design backbone, Analysis, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate. We chose the ADDIE model as it is a well-known and industry-recognized model. It was our hope, in keeping with the familiar, that we could help stakeholders better understand our departures into new models (eLearning Industry, 2020). Early on, we felt our learning design needed to address the human element, as our identified gaps included learner detachment. To do so we incorporated Design Thinking with the mindset of Human-Centered Design (HCD). Design thinking is a 5-step process that would overlay Human-Centered design thinking. Human-Centered Design utilizes two modes of thinking, convergent and divergent. When designing a learning experience, both modes of thinking place the learner at the center. Convergent thinking is logical and seeks to answer questions. While divergent thinking seeks to create ideas by asking new questions. By combining Design Thinking \u2014 which places the learner at the center of the design process \u2014 and Human-Centered Design, we ended up with the model shown in Figure 1: Using Human-Centered Design with Design Thinking (MovingWorlds, 2018). To break down our design process, we will summarize our steps through the context of the ADDIE model. When additional instructional design models are used, we will note actions taken in each ADDIE phase. As additional instructional design models may not be one-to-one inline with ADDIE, best efforts will be taken to correlate their relationships.

As the learner begins their journey, they will form the base of the pyramid and progressively move up the pyramid through the completion of each phase. Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy While designing each phase, we considered assessments and the instructional strategy to be used. As noted by Khalil, M. K., & Elkhider, I. A. (2016) there are three primary learning theories, behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructionism. We have identified the learning theory applied \u2014 informing instructional strategies to be applied \u2014 and the method to connect instruction and assessment, through each of the phases.

The Colorado Adult Education Professional Association, CAEPA, is a volunteer-run and a membership-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The association is led by 20 dedicated volunteers located throughout the State of Colorado. Volunteers come from diverse backgrounds and work environments, including local community and faith-based organizations, community colleges, school districts, corrections facilities, workforce districts, and libraries. These volunteers make up the board of directors and are the target audience. In their workplaces, volunteers have varying levels of experience with Google Workplace applications - some have none. Most volunteers are familiar with email and attachments but have not experienced other collaborative tools. Many are unfamiliar with shared online storage and may struggle with learning a new application. Most have set habits of communication that they use daily in their professional work environments and this training looks to broaden their horizons. Purpose/Goal \u00b6 What behavior or change does this training aim to implement? CAEPA needs new board members to demonstrate familiarity with Google Workspace to effectively communicate and collaborate with the board-at-large, within their first the month of joining the board of directors. Learning Objectives \u00b6 What are your measurable learning objectives? Google Chat \u00b6 By the end of the lesson, you will have practiced the following skills: Use Chat web application, https://chat.google.com Compose and format messages to individuals and groups Create and organize a room Turn on and search chat history Start a video chat Google Meet \u00b6 By the end of the lesson, you will have practiced the following skills: Sign in to Google Meet, https://meet.google.com Create a meeting Invite people to join a meeting Manage a meeting Change the view of the meeting Present your screen Platform & Logistics \u00b6 Where will learning occur and where will assets be stored? Utilizing Rise 360\u2019s online course builder, the content will be exported and imported into the Organization\u2019s learning management system (LMS). Currently, CAEPA has access to both Google Classroom and Moodle LMS. Moodle LMS is the stronger of the two options supporting SCORM and xAPI allowing completion to be recorded. Moodle LMS is a self-hosted service with unlimited storage, providing a secure place to save assets. Additionally, Google Forms will be used to provide pre- and post-surveys to the learners. These forms will be created, stored, and hosted through the organization\u2019s Google Drive. Data is stored within the application and collects the user\u2019s email as a personal identifier. For the eLearning Sampler , Review 360 will be used to demonstrate the course for simplicity, forgoing the need to login to the LMS for reviewing. When implemented, the learners will be provided their new organizational credentials and provided the link to LMS. Learners will be assigned a board member to contact as part of the training. The designated board member will also be available via phone if the learner needs technical assistance. Measures \u00b6 How will you track, measure, and report successful learning? Rise 360 and Moodle LMS support both SCORM and xAPI. Learners will be able to login to Moodle LMS using organizational credentials and access the course. Moodle will then track activity - time spent in course and completion. The course will be broken into sections by each Google Workspace application. Within each section, learners will be presented with a pre- and post-survey. Surveys will provide insight into learner\u2019s abilities to perform tasks within each application before and after completing the section. Each section of the course will be assessed independently. After the learner completes the activities within the section, they will be asked to complete a series of tasks demonstrating their new understandings. Tasks will be completed by the learner initiating a conversation, with their designated board member, using the application being introduced. If the learner can complete the tasks and communicate with their designated contact, the section is completed successfully. If the learner is struggling with the application, they may reach out to their designated contact using a more familiar method for additional technical support. Accessibility \u00b6 How will you ensure content adheres to the American\u2019s with Disabilities Act (ADA)? Rise 360 is known not to fully meet Section 508 or WCAG guidelines. The designer is aware of this; therefore, the designer will actively ensure that all content meets four-conditions: Content is easy to see Content is easy to hear Content is easy to interact with Content is easy to understand Since these conditions are subjective, the designer will utilize tota11y , a javascript-based accessibility checker, to identify accessibility issues relating to the four-conditions. The designer will aim to meet the highest guidelines (AAA) set forth by WCAG, exceeding Section 508 requirements. If accessibility issues are identified and are within the control of the designer, the content will be modified to pass the accessibility check. Additionally, transcripts will be provided for all audio and video included within the training. All images will include a descriptive caption text (alt-text). Engagement \u00b6 How will your training achieve extraordinary educational engagement? What is your unique value proposition? Learners will be introduced to core applications to increase productivity and help communication and collaboration within the organization. The learners will be entering the training with high intrinsic motivation, as the organization is volunteer-run; however, reliability to complete training may vary for the same reason. The organization will place extrinsic motivation, by requiring the applications included in the training to be used while actively participating on the board. The training will be \u201cchunked\u201d by each Google Workspace application the learner will explore. Within each section (chunk), the learners will have control over their learning paths - providing choice. The learner will be able to choose three paths, Certificate, Novice, or Experienced. They may choose to flow through one, two, or all three paths. The Certificate path leads to an external site containing a comprehensive tutorial on the given application and is provided by Google. Before exiting the course, learners are prompted to return to and continue learning with the next learning path. The Novice path provides a curated selection of videos from the Certificate path. Each video ranges from 2-3 minutes and covers the essential functions of each application. After viewing, the learner may choose to continue learning in the next learning path or move on to the assignments. The Experienced path provides an overview of the application\u2019s user interface. This learning path is aimed at learners who are familiar with the application. Learners will discover the application interface through an interactive screenshot. Labels will provide an animated gif as well as a text description of the functionality of the application interface. After completing the activity, learners may proceed to the assignments or continue learning in the alternate learning path. Ultimately all paths lead to the section\u2019s assignment list. This is a checklist of tasks to be completed with the learner\u2019s designated board member contact. Since Google Workspace applications are intended to foster team communication, each task completed in the course will be connecting the new board member to others serving on the board of directors. This communication is, in essence, the capstone of the course. Workflow \u00b6 Provide a visual workflow, demonstrating the learner\u2019s journey, branching, and assessment points.

The association is led by 20 dedicated volunteers located throughout the State of Colorado. Volunteers come from diverse backgrounds and work environments, including local community and faith-based organizations, community colleges, school districts, corrections facilities, workforce districts, and libraries. These volunteers make up the board of directors and are the target audience. In their workplaces, volunteers have varying levels of experience with Google Workplace applications - some have none. Most volunteers are familiar with email and attachments but have not experienced other collaborative tools. Many are unfamiliar with shared online storage and may struggle with learning a new application.

Moodle LMS is a self-hosted service with unlimited storage, providing a secure place to save assets. Additionally, Google Forms will be used to provide pre- and post-surveys to the learners. These forms will be created, stored, and hosted through the organization\u2019s Google Drive. Data is stored within the application and collects the user\u2019s email as a personal identifier. For the eLearning Sampler , Review 360 will be used to demonstrate the course for simplicity, forgoing the need to login to the LMS for reviewing.

Within each section, learners will be presented with a pre- and post-survey. Surveys will provide insight into learner\u2019s abilities to perform tasks within each application before and after completing the section. Each section of the course will be assessed independently. After the learner completes the activities within the section, they will be asked to complete a series of tasks demonstrating their new understandings. Tasks will be completed by the learner initiating a conversation, with their designated board member, using the application being introduced. If the learner can complete the tasks and communicate with their designated contact, the section is completed successfully. If the learner is struggling with the application, they may reach out to their designated contact using a more familiar method for additional technical support.","title":"Measures"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5660/2020-11-22-design-document-information-technology/#accessibility","text":"How will you ensure content adheres to the American\u2019s with Disabilities Act (ADA)?

What is your unique value proposition? Learners will be introduced to core applications to increase productivity and help communication and collaboration within the organization. The learners will be entering the training with high intrinsic motivation, as the organization is volunteer-run; however, reliability to complete training may vary for the same reason. The organization will place extrinsic motivation, by requiring the applications included in the training to be used while actively participating on the board. The training will be \u201cchunked\u201d by each Google Workspace application the learner will explore. Within each section (chunk), the learners will have control over their learning paths - providing choice. The learner will be able to choose three paths, Certificate, Novice, or Experienced. They may choose to flow through one, two, or all three paths. The Certificate path leads to an external site containing a comprehensive tutorial on the given application and is provided by Google. Before exiting the course, learners are prompted to return to and continue learning with the next learning path. The Novice path provides a curated selection of videos from the Certificate path. Each video ranges from 2-3 minutes and covers the essential functions of each application. After viewing, the learner may choose to continue learning in the next learning path or move on to the assignments. The Experienced path provides an overview of the application\u2019s user interface. This learning path is aimed at learners who are familiar with the application. Learners will discover the application interface through an interactive screenshot. Labels will provide an animated gif as well as a text description of the functionality of the application interface. After completing the activity, learners may proceed to the assignments or continue learning in the alternate learning path. Ultimately all paths lead to the section\u2019s assignment list. This is a checklist of tasks to be completed with the learner\u2019s designated board member contact.

I misread the topic for the assignment and started planning around a phrase - I missed the relationship to a song; therefore, I initially had planned a video around an introduction to Growth Mindset. This in itself was a good learning experience because as I was planning, I kept realizing how much I rely on interaction or interactivity when designing instructional materials. This had me going back and revising and thinking about how I could adapt the idea for an asynchronous video. However, as I said I had misread the topic and missed the song component - whoops. I noticed this about a week ago when I was reviewing the project guidelines about to record, silly me. So, I then freaked out and then started revising\u2026 I ended up sticking with the same theme but adjusted everything for a song relating to the Growth Mindset. I had a couple of variations and songs picked out, but since they are lesser-known - or not at all - this created a new challenge. I ended up remixing around a YouTube: Sesame Street song, it has been sampled and cut up, but I would think this project falls in the grey area for fair use/education copyright. Tools \u00b6 iPhone 12 mini Adobe Premiere Pro Successes \u00b6 At the end of the day, I pulled together a video, incorporating a word or phrase in a song, around the theme of Growth Mindset. As you can see, I took the creative piece and tried to have some fun with the video production at the end of the day. This is not what I might have pulled together if I was thinking strictly of an educational video production, which is a good learning experience for future reflections. I would consider that I was able to incorporate \u201cdraw my life\u201d concepts that I was watching as part of this unit a success. It was surprisingly difficult to pull off - but it did allow me to practice audio recording as well as experiment with a new type of video production. I\u2019m starting to feel comfortable with basic video editing, so I tried to push my abilities boundaries, for better or worse. Struggles \u00b6 Oh man, did I ever struggle? First with my poor reading skills. But then I struggled to pull my vision together while editing the video. One thing I am very disappointed with was I was not able to pull the background out of my layered video clips. I have no idea why? I watched several tutorials pull it off successfully and I did everything the same, but no matter the method I tried, it never quite worked. Either the layered video became a ghost, or the color of the layered video became severely off tone. I tried so many techniques and was too far in it to turn around. So, unfortunately, I had to settle for a ghostly result with background fragments. It could be my lighting during recording, but it also could have been a setting on my recording device. Either way, I will try the method again in the future. I also found the \u201cdraw your life\u201d handwriting or drawing to be a challenge too. The tutorials I watched made it sound so easy to adjust the timing of the video to the words - it is not.

I also have a feeling that illustrating food was not the best subject for the first experiment.","title":"Struggles"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5680/2021-03-13-mobile-media-project/#attributions","text":"Perfect Fried Eggs via Americas Test Kitchen Adobe Illustrator Google Sites","title":"Attributions"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5680/2021-03-28-alternate-media-project/","text":"Assignment \u00b6 Use a tool, format or combination from above and create a media item.

Ultimately what I'm looking for is something that makes sense and is effective to your individual situation. Example projects include: Instructional/Educational mobile app Series of 1 minute instructional tips or a longer video based narrative demonstrating a process Instructional/Educational mobile web site. Instructional/Educational podcast series Instructional/Educational eBook While there are no specific restrictions on the size or length of the final project you should evaluate your idea and apply your resources in a manner that best reflects your individual situation given the time allotted to complete the effort. A few years ago this course focused primarily on audio and video and I used to require student's projects to be at least 5 minutes of content and no longer than 20 minutes, you can use that as a guide if you would like. If you are creating an activity such as an instructional module or application, use the same time frame as a general guide around the length it should take a user to complete it. If you chose to create a series of media, I strongly recommend that you develop a method for distributing it. Sharing several links is not conducive to those on mobile devices. Successful projects in the past have built simple responsive pages/websites with the media embedded or simply created a playlist utilizing the their chosen delivery platform. If you are planning multiple angles, graphics, narration and alternatives, It could require a significant effort and would satisfy a final project. However, if the length and desired production of the video are planned to be shorter and simpler, I would prefer to see a little more than one short video for your final project. Remember, the overall experience on a mobile platform is critical towards your grade. Note: For grading, this project will be viewed solely on a mobile device and it's accessibility and functionality on that device will reflect the grade. YouTube is one of the best resources for disseminating video to all devices however, simply placing content on YouTube and deeming it \"mobile\" ready doesn't always do the job. We'll be looking at the video's format and how well it translates to a mobile device. Things to consider will be font size, readability of graphics, length etc. Info Title: CAEPA - Ambassador Leaders Tools: Moodle LMS Link: CAEPA - Ambassador Leaders (Moodle LMS) Link: CAEPA - Ambassador Leaders mobile (Moodle LMS) Learning/Experience \u00b6 The overall project is for CAEPA, a nonprofit, supporting Colorado Adult Educators. Admittedly, I am ambitious and I did not get to create all the media I was hoping to produce for this final project. I did, however, make great strides and produced nearly three microlearning courses, not including assessments. I had my hands full, with the media production and setting up a learning management system. And while designing the media, I was thinking about the future audience and how to make the media most relevant to them. In the end, I wanted to show off as many production tools as I could... unfortunately, I did not get through all that I hoped to. I had big plans for the Welcome and Introduction page for the Ambassador Leaders program. But I worked backward towards this all-important page/course. A page/course to inform future contributors about the professional learning model... Tools \u00b6 DreamHost Moodle iPhone 12 mini Quicktime Prezi Adobe Premiere Rush Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe Audition Successes \u00b6 I set up a self-hosted version of Moodle. I upgraded the self-hosted software successfully. I created a course for both versions of Adobe Premiere, Rush, and Pro. However, I only published the Rush version as when I was thinking about the final audience, most would not have access to Pro, but, Rush is free! I managed to create three micro-learning courses, or at least have them underway. Learning how to build a course in Moodle. Struggles \u00b6 I had one of those moments. You know the type. You follow the same procedure as you have done in the past, but the result is not as expected. I am describing my screencast and audio for the Adobe Premiere Rush course. I was working within Adobe Premiere Pro and the playback looks fine; however, when I nested the video and adjusted the durations, the quality became jittery. This has not happened in the past. Then, after recording the audio voiceover and importing it to Adobe Premiere and Adobe Audition, the quality deteriorated.

Ultimately what I'm looking for is something that makes sense and is effective to your individual situation. Example projects include: Instructional/Educational mobile app Series of 1 minute instructional tips or a longer video based narrative demonstrating a process Instructional/Educational mobile web site. Instructional/Educational podcast series Instructional/Educational eBook While there are no specific restrictions on the size or length of the final project you should evaluate your idea and apply your resources in a manner that best reflects your individual situation given the time allotted to complete the effort. A few years ago this course focused primarily on audio and video and I used to require student's projects to be at least 5 minutes of content and no longer than 20 minutes, you can use that as a guide if you would like. If you are creating an activity such as an instructional module or application, use the same time frame as a general guide around the length it should take a user to complete it. If you chose to create a series of media, I strongly recommend that you develop a method for distributing it. Sharing several links is not conducive to those on mobile devices. Successful projects in the past have built simple responsive pages/websites with the media embedded or simply created a playlist utilizing the their chosen delivery platform. If you are planning multiple angles, graphics, narration and alternatives, It could require a significant effort and would satisfy a final project. However, if the length and desired production of the video are planned to be shorter and simpler, I would prefer to see a little more than one short video for your final project. Remember, the overall experience on a mobile platform is critical towards your grade. Note: For grading, this project will be viewed solely on a mobile device and it's accessibility and functionality on that device will reflect the grade. YouTube is one of the best resources for disseminating video to all devices however, simply placing content on YouTube and deeming it \"mobile\" ready doesn't always do the job. We'll be looking at the video's format and how well it translates to a mobile device. Things to consider will be font size, readability of graphics, length etc. Info Title: CAEPA - Ambassador Leaders Tools: Moodle LMS Link: CAEPA - Ambassador Leaders (Moodle LMS) Link: CAEPA - Ambassador Leaders mobile (Moodle LMS)","title":"Assignment"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5680/2021-04-26-final-project/#learningexperience","text":"The overall project is for CAEPA, a nonprofit, supporting Colorado Adult Educators.

This presentation will be an introduction to the what and why instructors should be doing this\u2026 hint: to develop critical analysis and critical writing skills.

The student base they serve is just as diverse, coming from a variety of backgrounds and literacy levels, but are all Adult Learners seeking to gain their initial diploma and/or transition into College & Career programs. To keep this presentation relevant, a direct connection to better their student\u2019s will need to be made. This presentation should also convey a message of the ease of use in planning and emphasize that Media Literacy & Reader Response Theory can cross literacy levels, meeting the students where they are (inclusive design). Clear introductory examples should be included to support learners in building a foundational understanding, and could include how a single image or chunk of text can be viewed \u201ccorrectly\u201d but have completely different meanings derived from the students background - exemplifying critical analysis.

Instructional Challenge or Opportunity (with learning objectives / outcomes) \u00b6 Learning Goal: Learners will build a background knowledge and interest surrounding the ideas of Media Literacy & Readers Response Theory. Learning Objectives: Learners will be able to describe Media Literacy & Readers Response Theory. Learners will be able to explain why Media Literacy & Readers Response Theory is an important skill for their students. Design Solution (with referenced support) \u00b6 Describe how your project will help the learning audience achieve the learning objectives shared above. This presentation is intended to be an introduction to Media Literacy & Readers Response. A following lesson on each topic will cover the use of these ideas in classrooms more in-depth. For an introduction, I wanted to just scratch the surface of the topics and create interest in continuing to the next lesson. To do this, I provided definitions and very broad examples of what the topics entail. I also kept circling the \u201cwhy\u201d we want to bring these skills into our classrooms and programs. I often brought both the educator and student considerations into the introduction and provided examples of outcomes we might achieve Describe how the project achieves specific project requirements I utilized the Pecha Kucha platform to meet the project format. The service provides limited tools to create a 20x20 slide show. Audio can be recorded internally within the application, however slides need to be developed externally. I turned to Google Slides to create the visuals. At several points throughout the presentation I addressed the viewer in thinking questions and guided them to think externally to their classrooms and programs. This was intentionally done to drive a relevant connection between the materials and their practice. I also noted outcomes that could be expected from implementing the materials, educators like to know the outcomes. Images were used sparingly, to add fun emphasis; they were intended to be animated GIFS but they got lost in the translation between technologies. Text on the slides are present to complement the narration and are not read to the viewer. The 20x20 slide show is organized into three-parts that I believe weave together to form a full message. Describe how your design addresses inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations. And if your design does not address these recommendations, provide an explanation of why it does not. Include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. The Pecha Kucha platform creates closed captions from the uploaded audio. I utilized a black background to reduce eye strain and drive the viewers attention to the minimal white text presented on each slide. Grey text was used for secondary text and titles were foregone to limit distractions. Fonts were kept large, the smallest font size used is 18 pt. I kept things uniform and consistent using three basic slide layouts. These visual techniques were recommended in the TED Talk, \u201cHow to avoid Death by PowerPoint.\u201d I intended to use GIFs (images), but was not able to export slides in GIF format; however the images are large, clear, and uniform (not clipart). Images are intended to be fun and connect with the audio narration, providing added meaning. Narration was intentionally slow, to provide viewer time to process new ideas. This also narrowed the amount of information being spoken, so as not to cause the viewer cognitive overload. All these design decisions exist in our collaborative inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations. Describe how your design addresses basic graphic, audio, and text design guidelines. Please be specific and include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. I may have answered many of these in the last question, inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility. Graphics, audio, and text design all should be thought about in those terms. If they are not inclusive in design, UDL, or accessibility it does nobody any good. Formative Feedback \u00b6 Provide each formative evaluation question you shared with your peer reviewers and explain why you asked each question. What type of images would most enhance the audio? Additionally, does the audio still flow after fragmenting the continuous recording into slides? For the draft, I led with empty slides focusing attention to the narration. I was looking for feedback concerning the delivery of the message and new (uninfluenced) image ideas. I'm thinking of types of MEME's or \"Graphics\" to use. If Media Literacy is about breaking down hidden messages, how many examples to show and what of? I asked this question to focus on the visuals and receive feedback about images vs text on slides. With an empty slate, I left my peers with plenty of leeway to describe which slides would most benefit from images vs text. They all thought incorporating MEME\u2019s (GIFs) was a great idea. They also supported examples of types of media for media deconstruction to be used. I swayed away from these concrete visuals for the introduction. How do I bring in example \"TEXT\" while also keeping things simple? Would example text be unnecessary as this is only an introduction and cause cognitive overload? Leading back to the last question, this was focusing on concrete text examples. Peer feedback focused on some supporting text (titles and definitions) to lead the viewer in understanding, however not too much. Share the specifics of all peer reviews and explain what you did, or did not do, based on your feedback. Interestingly, my peers were uniformed in the feedback to the above questions. I was also in agreement. One reviewer thought images within a classroom would be appropriate, I did not include classroom images. Instead I used supportive text slides which were also referred to by all reviewers. Some thought images of types of media would be appropriate for different reasons. One being to show what media is (breadth) and the other for critical analysis. I found a GIF that flickered through simple images of a pencil, microphone, and paper. I also found a GIF of a newspaper with animated pictures (videos). These I thought showed that media comes in many forms. As for an example of media for critical analysis, I thought to hold off on these concrete examples for the next lessons. This is only an introduction building interest and background knowledge. Each reviewer also thought it would be helpful to have definitions in the slides. In the narration I included a definition for Media Literacy and Reader Response. These definitions now accompany the narration on the slides as well as \u201ckey ideas\u201d of the presentation. Address any feedback you have received from me. Your feedback affirmed I was on the right track with the scope of the presentation and I had outlined learning objectives that were achievable in the 20x20 timeframe. You mentioned that the proposal was clearly outlined and focused, as well as thinking about the larger training at the early stage would be ideal. I agree and fully thought this out. This introduction needs to tie into the next component, so thinking about the next lesson(s) will help achieve unity. Thank you Design Lessons Learned \u00b6 Please provide a concise and straightforward, yet personal reflection on the most important lessons you learned in your process of creating this project. When I first heard about the 20x20 Pecha Kucha platform in Digital Story Telling, I found it intimidating. But after collaborating in our inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations, working in our teams on a slide show, watching a TED Talk, and other sources I found it less so. Creating the first pieces of the design document helped get the presentation going. A 20x20 presentation doesn\u2019t require as much narration as I was expecting, it was actually fairly comfortable to speak through the twenty seconds. I enjoyed how this project pulled on so many of the design concepts we have looked at thus far in the course. I utilized the actual Pecha Kucha platform and found it okay to work with to create simple presentations. Like many platforms that I\u2019m discovering in LDT, it is a tool that pulls together user created content into some form. In this case, a slide show. The downside is without a paid account, audio is trapped in the platform. It is also misleading how recording the full-audio track doesn\u2019t break it into twenty second intervals. This limits the ability to edit. Pecha Kucha also doesn\u2019t support animations (GIF); well it does,, but does not animate them. Google Slides (Original Slides) I found that I can set auto play on Google Slides, however its timings are 3, 5, 10, 15, 30\u2026 seconds. Skipping over twenty-seconds. I found the URL can be manipulated to correct this, but finding the \u201cautoplay\u201d button is not obvious. I recorded the audio out of Pecha Kucha with Quicktime, but did not proceed to import it into Google Slides because of the UI issue of autoplay. Bibliography \u00b6 GIPHY. (2019, September 17).

I often brought both the educator and student considerations into the introduction and provided examples of outcomes we might achieve Describe how the project achieves specific project requirements I utilized the Pecha Kucha platform to meet the project format. The service provides limited tools to create a 20x20 slide show. Audio can be recorded internally within the application, however slides need to be developed externally. I turned to Google Slides to create the visuals. At several points throughout the presentation I addressed the viewer in thinking questions and guided them to think externally to their classrooms and programs. This was intentionally done to drive a relevant connection between the materials and their practice. I also noted outcomes that could be expected from implementing the materials, educators like to know the outcomes. Images were used sparingly, to add fun emphasis; they were intended to be animated GIFS but they got lost in the translation between technologies. Text on the slides are present to complement the narration and are not read to the viewer. The 20x20 slide show is organized into three-parts that I believe weave together to form a full message. Describe how your design addresses inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations. And if your design does not address these recommendations, provide an explanation of why it does not. Include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. The Pecha Kucha platform creates closed captions from the uploaded audio. I utilized a black background to reduce eye strain and drive the viewers attention to the minimal white text presented on each slide. Grey text was used for secondary text and titles were foregone to limit distractions. Fonts were kept large, the smallest font size used is 18 pt. I kept things uniform and consistent using three basic slide layouts. These visual techniques were recommended in the TED Talk, \u201cHow to avoid Death by PowerPoint.\u201d I intended to use GIFs (images), but was not able to export slides in GIF format; however the images are large, clear, and uniform (not clipart). Images are intended to be fun and connect with the audio narration, providing added meaning. Narration was intentionally slow, to provide viewer time to process new ideas. This also narrowed the amount of information being spoken, so as not to cause the viewer cognitive overload. All these design decisions exist in our collaborative inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations. Describe how your design addresses basic graphic, audio, and text design guidelines. Please be specific and include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. I may have answered many of these in the last question, inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility. Graphics, audio, and text design all should be thought about in those terms. If they are not inclusive in design, UDL, or accessibility it does nobody any good.","title":"Design Solution (with referenced support)"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5711/2021-07-11-design-document-presentation/#formative-feedback","text":"Provide each formative evaluation question you shared with your peer reviewers and explain why you asked each question. What type of images would most enhance the audio? Additionally, does the audio still flow after fragmenting the continuous recording into slides? For the draft, I led with empty slides focusing attention to the narration. I was looking for feedback concerning the delivery of the message and new (uninfluenced) image ideas. I'm thinking of types of MEME's or \"Graphics\" to use. If Media Literacy is about breaking down hidden messages, how many examples to show and what of? I asked this question to focus on the visuals and receive feedback about images vs text on slides. With an empty slate, I left my peers with plenty of leeway to describe which slides would most benefit from images vs text. They all thought incorporating MEME\u2019s (GIFs) was a great idea. They also supported examples of types of media for media deconstruction to be used. I swayed away from these concrete visuals for the introduction. How do I bring in example \"TEXT\" while also keeping things simple? Would example text be unnecessary as this is only an introduction and cause cognitive overload? Leading back to the last question, this was focusing on concrete text examples. Peer feedback focused on some supporting text (titles and definitions) to lead the viewer in understanding, however not too much. Share the specifics of all peer reviews and explain what you did, or did not do, based on your feedback. Interestingly, my peers were uniformed in the feedback to the above questions. I was also in agreement. One reviewer thought images within a classroom would be appropriate, I did not include classroom images. Instead I used supportive text slides which were also referred to by all reviewers. Some thought images of types of media would be appropriate for different reasons. One being to show what media is (breadth) and the other for critical analysis. I found a GIF that flickered through simple images of a pencil, microphone, and paper. I also found a GIF of a newspaper with animated pictures (videos). These I thought showed that media comes in many forms. As for an example of media for critical analysis, I thought to hold off on these concrete examples for the next lessons. This is only an introduction building interest and background knowledge. Each reviewer also thought it would be helpful to have definitions in the slides. In the narration I included a definition for Media Literacy and Reader Response. These definitions now accompany the narration on the slides as well as \u201ckey ideas\u201d of the presentation. Address any feedback you have received from me. Your feedback affirmed I was on the right track with the scope of the presentation and I had outlined learning objectives that were achievable in the 20x20 timeframe. You mentioned that the proposal was clearly outlined and focused, as well as thinking about the larger training at the early stage would be ideal. I agree and fully thought this out. This introduction needs to tie into the next component, so thinking about the next lesson(s) will help achieve unity.

When I first heard about the 20x20 Pecha Kucha platform in Digital Story Telling, I found it intimidating. But after collaborating in our inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations, working in our teams on a slide show, watching a TED Talk, and other sources I found it less so. Creating the first pieces of the design document helped get the presentation going. A 20x20 presentation doesn\u2019t require as much narration as I was expecting, it was actually fairly comfortable to speak through the twenty seconds. I enjoyed how this project pulled on so many of the design concepts we have looked at thus far in the course. I utilized the actual Pecha Kucha platform and found it okay to work with to create simple presentations. Like many platforms that I\u2019m discovering in LDT, it is a tool that pulls together user created content into some form. In this case, a slide show. The downside is without a paid account, audio is trapped in the platform. It is also misleading how recording the full-audio track doesn\u2019t break it into twenty second intervals. This limits the ability to edit. Pecha Kucha also doesn\u2019t support animations (GIF); well it does,, but does not animate them. Google Slides (Original Slides) I found that I can set auto play on Google Slides, however its timings are 3, 5, 10, 15, 30\u2026 seconds. Skipping over twenty-seconds. I found the URL can be manipulated to correct this, but finding the \u201cautoplay\u201d button is not obvious. I recorded the audio out of Pecha Kucha with Quicktime, but did not proceed to import it into Google Slides because of the UI issue of autoplay.","title":"Design Lessons Learned"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5711/2021-07-11-design-document-presentation/#bibliography","text":"GIPHY.

The training - in whole - will lead instructors in how to prepare and incorporate lessons concerning Media Literacy & Reader Response Theory meeting the College and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS). In its entirety, I am envisioning a three part microlearning module, with an embedded forum, and follow up interview (per learning design of the organization). Pecha Kucha Lesson 1: Introduction, was a broad overview to the what and why instructors should be doing this\u2026 hint: to develop critical analysis and critical writing skills. Infographic Lesson 2: Media Literacy, will introduce educators to the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy, providing an example of use. A correlation to CCRS will need to be addressed. The Infographic will represent the instructional sequence, leading students through critical analysis with media literacy in mind. Lesson 3 will introduce educators to the Reader's Response and will provide an example of how they can use the theory to support students in writing critically in the context of media literacy. Front-end Analysis: who, what, where, when \u00b6 Who is the infographic for? This presentation will be targeting the diverse field of Adult Basic Educators in Colorado who serve students in local community and faith-based organizations, community colleges, school districts, corrections facilities, workforce districts and libraries. The student base they serve is just as diverse, coming from a variety of backgrounds and literacy levels, but are all Adult Learners seeking to gain their initial diploma and/or transition into College & Career programs. To keep this presentation relevant, a direct connection to better their student\u2019s will need to be made. What content will the infographic cover? The Infographic will represent the instructional sequence, leading students through critical analysis with media literacy in mind. This will be an instructional tool, for both educators and students to use. Many resources and infographics exist for this concept, therefore I will be remixing ideas into an original remixed Infographic to better serve this professional learning module and the audience. Where and when will the infographic be used? The infographic will be incorporated into a microlearning training covering Media Literacy & Reader Response Theory, it will be visible in part 2 of 3 + a forum for learner interaction and planning. It will be distributed through the Colorado Adult Educators Professional Association (CAEPA) and will be housed within the association's learning management system. Instructional Challenge or Opportunity \u00b6 Microlearning Goal: Have Colorado Adult Educators use Media Literacy and Readers Response Theory within lessons meeting the College and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS). Learning Goal (Infographic): The infographic will present an instructional sequence and critical analysis question relating to media literacy in a quick and clear way for educator and student use. Learning Objectives (Infographic): Learners will recognize questions to ask in each stage of critical analysis relating to media literacy. Learners will interpret the flow of critical analysis questions relating to media literacy. Design Solution \u00b6 Describe how your project will help the learning audience achieve the learning objectives shared above. For the project I created two infographics to support the learning goal. Each infographic was designed identically to support cross referencing between the two documents. This was done to achieve differentiation and alternative explanations of similar ideas. It was also done to demonstrate the critical media analysis has multiple points of entry for questions to ask. This can be expanded upon in the full training. The learning objectives are supported by the design of the infographics. Utilizing the visual design element of chronological, genealogical, or hierarchical representation, the graphics instructions are embedded in a top down order. However, critical analysis allows for learners to diverge and explore these questions in any order they feel. To further support interpretation, a firmly embedded instructional sequence is present. This is expressed through an explicit numbering to the questions. This not only supports a sequence, but also denotes the number of steps of analysis to complete. To further support the sequence between the two infographics, common icons are used, in the same order. This is to support learners in navigating between the two infographics while also supporting the growth of critical media analysis questions to ask and at what stage. When combining together the information between the two infographics, the readers (learners and instructors) can choose how to utilize them in class. They can be used independently or in conjunction with each other. When looked at as a whole, the graphics provide multiple ways to interpret each stage of critical media analysis, but are linked together through the visual cues of the numbering and icons. Describe how the project achieves specific project requirements. For the Infographic project, describe how the project includes two of the four visual infographic elements. From the infographic checklist, the project includes two of the four required visual elements. First, visual representation of an instructional sequence was the primary focus. In remixing two separate infographics, sequence was guiding the organization. Each infographic employs five steps to employ for critical analysis of media. Two infographics were created to support two different methods of analysis. However, in designing the graphics I attempted to make clear that even though the questions may be different, the stage of analysis is the same across the graphics. This was achieved in utilizing numbers and icons. Second, a chronological, genealogical, or hierarchical representation was used to support the first visual element. Just like the numbers and icons support the sequence, they also convey a hierarchical representation. The documents are intended to be read top down, following the sequential numbering. However, viewers may choose to navigate in both directions as they complete their analysis, just as they chose to cross from one graphic to the next for additional questions to ask for analysis. Additionally, the infographics utilize four elements for a successful infographic (Wells, 2016) in various ways. As these are remixes, I brought in my unique style to the design. Many documents I create for instruction look very similar but follow graphic design principles. As I remixed, I simplified and reorganized the original text to convey a simple message. In a sense this also falls back to my unique style of minimalism. These infographics probably lack the luster of some other more creative designed infographics, but this was done to keep things simple. Less is more, sometimes. However, these infographics are highly shareable. They are sized for standard US paper sizes, clean, and easy to understand. They may not be the most creative indesign, but they should be highly usable for the reader. Describe how your design addresses inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations. And if your design does not address these recommendations, provide an explanation of why it does not. Include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. First, inclusive design is based in iteration and the infographics were updated after receiving peer feedback, or iterated upon. Following some basic graphic design principles also helped establish a clear structure, see next section for more details. Both examples were offered in Garcias\u2019 (2019) inclusive design guidelines. As noted in Universal Design for Learning, presenting information in multiple ways will provide means for more learners to access the information. Even though these are infographics, the combination of numbers, icons, and text provide various ways to navigate the document. I believe this supports multiple ways of conveying information. Additionally, two graphics representing two different analysis questions were created. This allows for differentiation of materials and provides more than one type of question for analysis. Even though these infographics are not created using web technologies, they still adhere to print accessibility. Proper formatting of headings and body text was used through the document. A sans serif font was selected to create a better screen reading experience, while also creating a modern print document. Text is heavy but clear, creating an accessible color contrast in the document throughout. The layouts are uniformed to allow for easy navigation. These guidelines can be found through the Web Accessibility Initiative , as well as the LDT Style Tips . Describe how your design addresses basic graphic, audio, and text design guidelines. Please be specific and include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. From Rawal\u2019s 10 Basic Principles of Graphic Design (2018), I thought about each principle. I intentionally used several of the principles described. Alignment plays a key role in both infographics. All numbers and icons are aligned, as is all the heading and body text. This gives the graphic a rigid form to guide the reader vertically through the information. Proximity was crafted in the spacing between the numbers, icons, and the supporting text. This was to allow the reader to have visual cues as to the sequencing of the information. Icons were selected to further support the visual cues. These are intentionally aligned and spaced to support the reader in distinguishing the separate steps in the sequences. To note the proximity of each connects the three elements with the need for hard borders. Both infographics use strong repetition to keep the information uniformed and non distracting for the reader. The layouts in each graphic are identical, as is the layout of the text. This allows the readers to easily navigate between the two documents. Additionally, the same icons - representing the same steps of sequence - are used to tie the two infographics together. A visual hierarchy is created using typography. A large title is present followed by a trail of icons of similar height. I believe this is connecting the title to the icons. With the icon's proximity to the body text, this leads to the connection to the information. The body text also uses a visual hierarchy, with a larger bolder heading followed by lighter descriptive text. Color & contrast were a consideration during the design. Contrast was applied to the font weight to visually distinguish headings from body text. Additionally, on one graphic the body text was also varied to visually note a concept from a question. The absence of color was intentional, creating a black and white document. This was altered after peer feedback agreed with my questioning that it created a dull infographic. Therefore, color was designed back in as another visual cue to the organization. From Govender\u2019s Designing Instructional Text (2021), the most notable principle present is principle 1: simplify. I simplified the information in both infographics as I remixed them. The originals had the text organized oddly, or included too much information. I reduced the text and created a uniform flow. This was intentionally done to support the reader in finding information easily. Additionally, principle 2: personalisation was incorporated through the use of icons. These were intentionally chosen to highlight the idea they are supporting, breaking the textual information and welcoming and supporting the reader. Formative Feedback \u00b6 Provide each formative evaluation question you shared with your peer reviewers and explain why you asked each question. I took a less is more approach, but now I am wondering if I overly simplified the infographics. They seem stark and boring without color. Would color or visuals enhance the messaging of these infographics, i.e. people and technology? Do the selected icons add meaning or are they not relevant? I asked this question in reference to the 10 basic graphic design elements. One infographic, that was remixed, was rich in color and I found it to be both supportive and yet confusing. I opted to strip out the color and rely on other design elements to support the reader. It was also done in knowing that if an instructor or student printed the infographic the color would likely be lost anyways. I also struggle with adding images because the infographic is icon centric. I was looking for peer input on this decision as well. I have not included baseline instructions or an overview... I was thinking the instructional sequence is obvious. Am I wrong about this? Should I create a tagline of intent and purpose following the Title? Additionally, I included a \"Find more Media Literacy resources...\" leading back to the source. Do I need to create a more formal reference/citation? The icons also require attribution (CC-BY), would small text be distracting? Or a reference/attribution block? I included this question for insight about adding additional information. The opening questions were about informing the Universal Design qualities of the infographic - is it self explanatory or do I need to add in more supportive text. The second half of the question was more technical, asking about citations and references. I was looking for insight as to how \u201cbest\u201d to include this additional information. One font (Source Sans Pro) used is throughout, however I used different styles to denote different text blocks (black, thin, italics). The body text within the Five Questions Infographic has two parts distinguished solely with text styles. Would a change in font size and/or adding the labels - Concept/Question - be helpful/distracting to the viewer? Also, the thin font is also grey - is it too light? This question was asked to check if the color, contrast, and hierarchy of text was visually being conveyed. As mentioned in the question I was brainstorming in adding in supportive labels but was seeking peer input in the decision. I also asked specifically about the thin and lightened font selection. Just because it's readable on my screen doesn\u2019t mean it is for others. This was checking on text accessibility and any modifications that needed to be iterated upon. Bonus: In the \"Is This Story...\" Infographic there is a two part question for Step 3. I'm not sure if it is clear it is a two step question, or if it looks odd as it is currently designed. Any suggestions on how to alleviate this? I was considering removing \"Is this story news or opinion?\" and simplifying it to just one question, \"Is this story supported by facts?\" Suggestions? This was a bonus question, as it was question number four. I asked this because in remixing I was simplifying the original text. However, the original critical media literacy questions presented a different number of steps to complete. I was looking for peer insight on if eliminating part of a two part question could be an answer, or if leaving as it has any detrimental effect to the infographic. Share the specifics of all peer reviews and explain what you did, or did not do, based on your feedback. My first question for peer review concerned color, icons, and images. Overall, peer feedback enjoyed the minimalist approach. Icons supported the message and no mention of including images. However, all thought a small pop of color would be beneficial. During the revision, I played with many different ways to pull in color. However, I kept falling back to having black text. I ended up with accent colored borders around the numbers and icons. I found this to be the least distracting to the overall design, but incorporating pops of color at the same time. I think adding some type of color scheme would be beneficial. I definitely agree with the less is more approach, however adding some pops of color I think would capture a wider audience. In terms of icons, I think the icons are fine for the infographic. They add a quick visual to show you what each number is about without having to read the entire bullet (Liz). Adding color to some areas could be helpful to the overall appeal of the infographic. I like the selected icons. They definitely add meaning and help break up the information provided (Julie). I agree with Julie and Liz, While I like the less is more approach I do think some additional color would be helpful to make the presentation a little more visually appealing. I think sticking to 2-3 additional pops of color could really add some more visual interest (Lillian). The second question concerned adding information, both a tagline and citations. This was testing the Universal Design of the document - is it understandable. Overall, peers felt an introduction - tagline, byline - would be beneficial to the infographics. I incorporated a small block of text to introduce each infographic. As for citations, I opted for Julie's suggestion of utilizing a QR code. This embeds a link to an external resource with references, resources, and attributions (for the icons CC-BY). I do agree with you that the instructional sequence is obvious, however I think it would be beneficial to include a purpose/tagline of intent following the Title. I was a little confused reading it myself and had to look at the original infographic for help. I also think a Find more Media Literacy resources link would be helpful for more information to be helpful (Liz). I think a brief introduction statement could be helpful to clarify the purpose of the infographic. I do think the flow works well though. I think you could add a QR code to help bring attention and make access to the reference page easier (Julie). I think adding a tagline and a short intent of purpose could help orient more entry level viewers. Personally if it's only one learn more resource you are sharing I think it's fine how it is. If you had several links/ articles you were sharing a more formal \"learn more\" section would be helpful (Lillian). The third question concerned the text hierarchy, adding labels, and accessibility of grayscale text used. I was affirmed that the font weights supported the hierarchy of the text flow. The majority thought including labels would be beneficial to the understanding of the infographic with multiple body text types. In revision I added in the labels \u201cconcept\u201d and \u201cquestion\u201d to help clarify this aspect. I also decreased the font size of one label to further the emphasis of two separate points being made in the body text. In asking about the readability of the grayscale text, I found that it was a few shades light (50%). I increased the contrast of the grayscale text to 80%? - or adjusted it to black. I think using the different styles to denote different text blocks is beneficial for the audience. It is a simple way to help the audience distinguish between different parts of the infographic (Liz). Different styles of text definitely helps differentiate the information. I think adding labels would be helpful and not distracting. I do think that the shade of grey is a little too light. I like the color contrast but maybe just a shade or two darker of grey, if possible (Julie). I like that the font is all under the same umbrella and you are not changing fonts. I would say adding labels or concept/ question type things would be more helpful to the viewer than changing the fonts (Lillian). I added a bonus question to help me assess the irregularity I created in remixing an original infographic. I ended up with a single two-step question. I asked for insight if it was noticeable, out of place, and problematic to remove. I received two different suggestions. One offered a way to combine the questions into one question. The other may have been suggesting to add a new numbered step. Since I wanted to keep the amount of steps consistent across the infographics, I opted to combine the question down. I kept the question that had a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d outcome, and combined the description texts. I think you can combine the two questions into one. Maybe something like \"Is this story supported by facts or opinions?\" (Julie). Honestly I didn't even notice it was two questions under one number until it was pointed out. But now that I see it it does look odd. Is there a reason those have to be under the same number? To me they seem like distinct concepts with how you have them explained (Lillian). Address any feedback you have received from me. Your feedback was once again reaffirming that the project - in its entirety - was moving in the right direction. The thought that the infographics were actionable media projects was excellent. I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those words, but that was definitely my intention. I wanted to create something that I could put into educators and students' hands to support them in media analysis. The overall arching idea did lend itself easily to the project guidelines, graphic design elements, and of course inclusive design, universal design, and accessibility guidelines, as you mentioned. I can only hope I produced an end product that meets these. Your final comment concerning learning objectives was highly valued, and something easy to overlook. When creating lower level learning objectives, it is possible to have more, but as we reach for the higher cognitive learning objectives it is better to create focus with fewer objectives. Thank you for the feedback. I love the idea of this project supporting something relevant to you that you will put into use and share with others. It has the potential to engage your learning audience in a relevant and instructional way. One thing that's nice for an infographic to accomplish is encouraging learners to take action in their own practice. For your infographic the call to action is also tied to learning more and continuing through the module. I can already imagine ways you will be able to address the required elements for the project... For example, if the learning objectives involve lower level processing such as define and describe then an infographic can easily address three objectives. If the learning objective involves more complex processing -- such as evaluate. apply, create -- then an infographic may only address one learning objective. Design Lessons Learned \u00b6 Please provide a concise and straightforward, yet personal reflection on the most important lessons you learned in your process of creating this project. For this project I learned from my misreadings of how to complete this design document. I hope that I better addressed each section of the design this round. Creating the infographics was fun. I choose to create two infographics to make the lessons more adaptable and flexible as stated above. I also think this helps keep the graphics simple as opposed to trying to create a singular infographic that would overwhelm the reader. I think both of the original graphics were poorly designed so it was a good opportunity to remix the content into a better design. I hope I was successful. I utilized Adobe Illustrator and inDesign to produce the infographics. I am becoming versed in how to flex the power of these tools. For these infographics I only used the basic tools in each platform - nothing fancy. I think the most challenging and fun aspect of this project was in icon selection. I used one of my favorite curators of icons, the noun project, to search at icons that represented the stage of analysis. Bibliography \u00b6 Cornell University. (n.d.).

The result is a really long infographic! It likely could be broken into two... During the revision, the focus also shifted from how to use a framework to introducing frameworks and lessons - using data to show relevance. I realize the document is text heavy; however I did try to use some design decisions to emphasize and draw the reader through the document while using graphs and icons to draw attention to details. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe inDesign Addressing feedback \u00b6 Infographic or comic book. Is rich with instructional value Combining the two originals into a single document connects the two. Previously I may have created instructional documents (or job aids). I then included relevant data before each framework or lesson provided. This was to create a connection, need, and value for Media Literacy. All combined it adds to a \"story\" of the importance of analyzing media. Looking back at the learning objectives, I think these need to be modified as I diverged from the original idea. Original learning objectives Learners will recognize questions to ask in each stage of critical analysis relating to media literacy. Learners will interpret the flow of critical analysis questions relating to media literacy. Revised learning objectives Learners will recognize questions to ask related to media inquiry. Learners will identify two Media Literacy frameworks. Learners will interpret how asking questions about media uncovers the explicit and implicit messaging. Infographic: At a minimum contains two of the following five visual infographic element In this revision I incorporated new ideas and representations to meet this requirement. Visual representation of statistical data: I have included relevant data throughout the graphic. I included one statistic to support each framework or lesson. I provided text summaries to support accessibility (screen readers) and included visual representations. Mapped / annotated picture or diagram: This is very loosely used in the comparison of vertical vs lateral reading and again very loosely used in outlining the frameworks or lesson steps. Visual representation of a sequence: The media literacy frameworks are based on a chronological sequence, SIFT and Five Key questions. The \"is it share worthy?\" The lesson is modified to mirror the Five Key questions - diverging from the original that was flow-chart based. In retrospect, adding in arrows pointing from one step to the next would make this sequential order more explicit. Chronological, genealogical, or hierarchical visual representation: Not related to content. Compare and contrast visual representation: This was used in lesson inspiration comparing vertical reading and lateral reading. Within the data representations, there are graphics to compare different statistics; such as media usage by ages and media analysis confidence between 2016 & 2019. Infographic or comic book. Addresses basic graphic, audio, and text design guidelines such as those outlined in our Six-word Design Guidelines. In this revision I incorporated color from the outset of the design. I used it to create structure, data vs framework or lesson. The right margin of the document is utilizing negative space, as is the spacing between text and graphics. Headers are pulled to the left to create some negative space. Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity (CARP) are strongly used throughout. Contrast and color is used in sectioning, and distinguishing summary text from body text. Alignments are kept left, and are uniformed throughout the document. Repetition is used throughout the sectioning - data followed by framework or lesson (repeat) - this is reinforced through color. Data visualizations included summary text to support accessibility. I attempted to create simple content that is consistently displayed... and more considerations were made throughout. Infographic: Calls the learning audience to action. It may still be a weak call to action, but now it is explicitly stated that the graphic is intended to have the reader start thinking about and applying Media Literacy in their lives. It is distinguished as a footer of the document mirroring the header of the document. The more resources link still exists.","title":"Design Document: Infographic"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5711/2021-07-25-design-document-infographic/#design-document-infographic","text":"Representing the instructional sequence to critical analysis of media Adobe Illustrator, Adobe inDesign","title":"Design Document: Infographic"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5711/2021-07-25-design-document-infographic/#overview","text":"This presentation will be an introduction to a professional learning microlearning training targeting Adult Basic Educators in Colorado.

For the project I created two infographics to support the learning goal. Each infographic was designed identically to support cross referencing between the two documents. This was done to achieve differentiation and alternative explanations of similar ideas. It was also done to demonstrate the critical media analysis has multiple points of entry for questions to ask. This can be expanded upon in the full training. The learning objectives are supported by the design of the infographics. Utilizing the visual design element of chronological, genealogical, or hierarchical representation, the graphics instructions are embedded in a top down order. However, critical analysis allows for learners to diverge and explore these questions in any order they feel. To further support interpretation, a firmly embedded instructional sequence is present. This is expressed through an explicit numbering to the questions. This not only supports a sequence, but also denotes the number of steps of analysis to complete. To further support the sequence between the two infographics, common icons are used, in the same order. This is to support learners in navigating between the two infographics while also supporting the growth of critical media analysis questions to ask and at what stage. When combining together the information between the two infographics, the readers (learners and instructors) can choose how to utilize them in class. They can be used independently or in conjunction with each other. When looked at as a whole, the graphics provide multiple ways to interpret each stage of critical media analysis, but are linked together through the visual cues of the numbering and icons. Describe how the project achieves specific project requirements. For the Infographic project, describe how the project includes two of the four visual infographic elements. From the infographic checklist, the project includes two of the four required visual elements. First, visual representation of an instructional sequence was the primary focus. In remixing two separate infographics, sequence was guiding the organization. Each infographic employs five steps to employ for critical analysis of media. Two infographics were created to support two different methods of analysis. However, in designing the graphics I attempted to make clear that even though the questions may be different, the stage of analysis is the same across the graphics. This was achieved in utilizing numbers and icons. Second, a chronological, genealogical, or hierarchical representation was used to support the first visual element. Just like the numbers and icons support the sequence, they also convey a hierarchical representation. The documents are intended to be read top down, following the sequential numbering. However, viewers may choose to navigate in both directions as they complete their analysis, just as they chose to cross from one graphic to the next for additional questions to ask for analysis. Additionally, the infographics utilize four elements for a successful infographic (Wells, 2016) in various ways. As these are remixes, I brought in my unique style to the design. Many documents I create for instruction look very similar but follow graphic design principles. As I remixed, I simplified and reorganized the original text to convey a simple message. In a sense this also falls back to my unique style of minimalism. These infographics probably lack the luster of some other more creative designed infographics, but this was done to keep things simple. Less is more, sometimes. However, these infographics are highly shareable. They are sized for standard US paper sizes, clean, and easy to understand. They may not be the most creative indesign, but they should be highly usable for the reader. Describe how your design addresses inclusive design, UDL, and accessibility recommendations. And if your design does not address these recommendations, provide an explanation of why it does not. Include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. First, inclusive design is based in iteration and the infographics were updated after receiving peer feedback, or iterated upon. Following some basic graphic design principles also helped establish a clear structure, see next section for more details. Both examples were offered in Garcias\u2019 (2019) inclusive design guidelines. As noted in Universal Design for Learning, presenting information in multiple ways will provide means for more learners to access the information. Even though these are infographics, the combination of numbers, icons, and text provide various ways to navigate the document. I believe this supports multiple ways of conveying information. Additionally, two graphics representing two different analysis questions were created. This allows for differentiation of materials and provides more than one type of question for analysis. Even though these infographics are not created using web technologies, they still adhere to print accessibility. Proper formatting of headings and body text was used through the document. A sans serif font was selected to create a better screen reading experience, while also creating a modern print document. Text is heavy but clear, creating an accessible color contrast in the document throughout. The layouts are uniformed to allow for easy navigation. These guidelines can be found through the Web Accessibility Initiative , as well as the LDT Style Tips . Describe how your design addresses basic graphic, audio, and text design guidelines. Please be specific and include citations from our readings and viewings in support of your decisions. From Rawal\u2019s 10 Basic Principles of Graphic Design (2018), I thought about each principle. I intentionally used several of the principles described. Alignment plays a key role in both infographics. All numbers and icons are aligned, as is all the heading and body text. This gives the graphic a rigid form to guide the reader vertically through the information. Proximity was crafted in the spacing between the numbers, icons, and the supporting text. This was to allow the reader to have visual cues as to the sequencing of the information. Icons were selected to further support the visual cues. These are intentionally aligned and spaced to support the reader in distinguishing the separate steps in the sequences. To note the proximity of each connects the three elements with the need for hard borders. Both infographics use strong repetition to keep the information uniformed and non distracting for the reader. The layouts in each graphic are identical, as is the layout of the text. This allows the readers to easily navigate between the two documents. Additionally, the same icons - representing the same steps of sequence - are used to tie the two infographics together. A visual hierarchy is created using typography. A large title is present followed by a trail of icons of similar height. I believe this is connecting the title to the icons. With the icon's proximity to the body text, this leads to the connection to the information. The body text also uses a visual hierarchy, with a larger bolder heading followed by lighter descriptive text. Color & contrast were a consideration during the design. Contrast was applied to the font weight to visually distinguish headings from body text. Additionally, on one graphic the body text was also varied to visually note a concept from a question. The absence of color was intentional, creating a black and white document. This was altered after peer feedback agreed with my questioning that it created a dull infographic. Therefore, color was designed back in as another visual cue to the organization. From Govender\u2019s Designing Instructional Text (2021), the most notable principle present is principle 1: simplify. I simplified the information in both infographics as I remixed them. The originals had the text organized oddly, or included too much information. I reduced the text and created a uniform flow. This was intentionally done to support the reader in finding information easily. Additionally, principle 2: personalisation was incorporated through the use of icons. These were intentionally chosen to highlight the idea they are supporting, breaking the textual information and welcoming and supporting the reader.","title":"Design Solution"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5711/2021-07-25-design-document-infographic/#formative-feedback","text":"Provide each formative evaluation question you shared with your peer reviewers and explain why you asked each question. I took a less is more approach, but now I am wondering if I overly simplified the infographics. They seem stark and boring without color. Would color or visuals enhance the messaging of these infographics, i.e. people and technology? Do the selected icons add meaning or are they not relevant? I asked this question in reference to the 10 basic graphic design elements. One infographic, that was remixed, was rich in color and I found it to be both supportive and yet confusing. I opted to strip out the color and rely on other design elements to support the reader. It was also done in knowing that if an instructor or student printed the infographic the color would likely be lost anyways. I also struggle with adding images because the infographic is icon centric. I was looking for peer input on this decision as well. I have not included baseline instructions or an overview... I was thinking the instructional sequence is obvious. Am I wrong about this? Should I create a tagline of intent and purpose following the Title? Additionally, I included a \"Find more Media Literacy resources...\" leading back to the source. Do I need to create a more formal reference/citation? The icons also require attribution (CC-BY), would small text be distracting? Or a reference/attribution block? I included this question for insight about adding additional information. The opening questions were about informing the Universal Design qualities of the infographic - is it self explanatory or do I need to add in more supportive text. The second half of the question was more technical, asking about citations and references. I was looking for insight as to how \u201cbest\u201d to include this additional information. One font (Source Sans Pro) used is throughout, however I used different styles to denote different text blocks (black, thin, italics). The body text within the Five Questions Infographic has two parts distinguished solely with text styles. Would a change in font size and/or adding the labels - Concept/Question - be helpful/distracting to the viewer? Also, the thin font is also grey - is it too light? This question was asked to check if the color, contrast, and hierarchy of text was visually being conveyed. As mentioned in the question I was brainstorming in adding in supportive labels but was seeking peer input in the decision. I also asked specifically about the thin and lightened font selection. Just because it's readable on my screen doesn\u2019t mean it is for others. This was checking on text accessibility and any modifications that needed to be iterated upon. Bonus: In the \"Is This Story...\" Infographic there is a two part question for Step 3. I'm not sure if it is clear it is a two step question, or if it looks odd as it is currently designed. Any suggestions on how to alleviate this? I was considering removing \"Is this story news or opinion?\" and simplifying it to just one question, \"Is this story supported by facts?\" Suggestions? This was a bonus question, as it was question number four. I asked this because in remixing I was simplifying the original text. However, the original critical media literacy questions presented a different number of steps to complete. I was looking for peer insight on if eliminating part of a two part question could be an answer, or if leaving as it has any detrimental effect to the infographic. Share the specifics of all peer reviews and explain what you did, or did not do, based on your feedback. My first question for peer review concerned color, icons, and images. Overall, peer feedback enjoyed the minimalist approach. Icons supported the message and no mention of including images. However, all thought a small pop of color would be beneficial. During the revision, I played with many different ways to pull in color. However, I kept falling back to having black text. I ended up with accent colored borders around the numbers and icons. I found this to be the least distracting to the overall design, but incorporating pops of color at the same time. I think adding some type of color scheme would be beneficial. I definitely agree with the less is more approach, however adding some pops of color I think would capture a wider audience. In terms of icons, I think the icons are fine for the infographic. They add a quick visual to show you what each number is about without having to read the entire bullet (Liz). Adding color to some areas could be helpful to the overall appeal of the infographic. I like the selected icons. They definitely add meaning and help break up the information provided (Julie). I agree with Julie and Liz, While I like the less is more approach I do think some additional color would be helpful to make the presentation a little more visually appealing. I think sticking to 2-3 additional pops of color could really add some more visual interest (Lillian). The second question concerned adding information, both a tagline and citations. This was testing the Universal Design of the document - is it understandable. Overall, peers felt an introduction - tagline, byline - would be beneficial to the infographics. I incorporated a small block of text to introduce each infographic. As for citations, I opted for Julie's suggestion of utilizing a QR code. This embeds a link to an external resource with references, resources, and attributions (for the icons CC-BY). I do agree with you that the instructional sequence is obvious, however I think it would be beneficial to include a purpose/tagline of intent following the Title. I was a little confused reading it myself and had to look at the original infographic for help. I also think a Find more Media Literacy resources link would be helpful for more information to be helpful (Liz). I think a brief introduction statement could be helpful to clarify the purpose of the infographic. I do think the flow works well though. I think you could add a QR code to help bring attention and make access to the reference page easier (Julie). I think adding a tagline and a short intent of purpose could help orient more entry level viewers. Personally if it's only one learn more resource you are sharing I think it's fine how it is. If you had several links/ articles you were sharing a more formal \"learn more\" section would be helpful (Lillian). The third question concerned the text hierarchy, adding labels, and accessibility of grayscale text used. I was affirmed that the font weights supported the hierarchy of the text flow. The majority thought including labels would be beneficial to the understanding of the infographic with multiple body text types. In revision I added in the labels \u201cconcept\u201d and \u201cquestion\u201d to help clarify this aspect. I also decreased the font size of one label to further the emphasis of two separate points being made in the body text. In asking about the readability of the grayscale text, I found that it was a few shades light (50%). I increased the contrast of the grayscale text to 80%? - or adjusted it to black. I think using the different styles to denote different text blocks is beneficial for the audience. It is a simple way to help the audience distinguish between different parts of the infographic (Liz). Different styles of text definitely helps differentiate the information. I think adding labels would be helpful and not distracting. I do think that the shade of grey is a little too light. I like the color contrast but maybe just a shade or two darker of grey, if possible (Julie). I like that the font is all under the same umbrella and you are not changing fonts. I would say adding labels or concept/ question type things would be more helpful to the viewer than changing the fonts (Lillian). I added a bonus question to help me assess the irregularity I created in remixing an original infographic. I ended up with a single two-step question. I asked for insight if it was noticeable, out of place, and problematic to remove. I received two different suggestions. One offered a way to combine the questions into one question. The other may have been suggesting to add a new numbered step. Since I wanted to keep the amount of steps consistent across the infographics, I opted to combine the question down. I kept the question that had a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d outcome, and combined the description texts. I think you can combine the two questions into one. Maybe something like \"Is this story supported by facts or opinions?\" (Julie). Honestly I didn't even notice it was two questions under one number until it was pointed out. But now that I see it it does look odd. Is there a reason those have to be under the same number? To me they seem like distinct concepts with how you have them explained (Lillian). Address any feedback you have received from me. Your feedback was once again reaffirming that the project - in its entirety - was moving in the right direction. The thought that the infographics were actionable media projects was excellent. I hadn\u2019t thought about it in those words, but that was definitely my intention. I wanted to create something that I could put into educators and students' hands to support them in media analysis. The overall arching idea did lend itself easily to the project guidelines, graphic design elements, and of course inclusive design, universal design, and accessibility guidelines, as you mentioned. I can only hope I produced an end product that meets these. Your final comment concerning learning objectives was highly valued, and something easy to overlook. When creating lower level learning objectives, it is possible to have more, but as we reach for the higher cognitive learning objectives it is better to create focus with fewer objectives. Thank you for the feedback. I love the idea of this project supporting something relevant to you that you will put into use and share with others. It has the potential to engage your learning audience in a relevant and instructional way. One thing that's nice for an infographic to accomplish is encouraging learners to take action in their own practice. For your infographic the call to action is also tied to learning more and continuing through the module. I can already imagine ways you will be able to address the required elements for the project... For example, if the learning objectives involve lower level processing such as define and describe then an infographic can easily address three objectives. If the learning objective involves more complex processing -- such as evaluate. apply, create -- then an infographic may only address one learning objective.","title":"Formative Feedback"},{"location":"Learning-Experience-Design/INTE-5711/2021-07-25-design-document-infographic/#design-lessons-learned","text":"Please provide a concise and straightforward, yet personal reflection on the most important lessons you learned in your process of creating this project. For this project I learned from my misreadings of how to complete this design document. I hope that I better addressed each section of the design this round. Creating the infographics was fun. I choose to create two infographics to make the lessons more adaptable and flexible as stated above. I also think this helps keep the graphics simple as opposed to trying to create a singular infographic that would overwhelm the reader. I think both of the original graphics were poorly designed so it was a good opportunity to remix the content into a better design. I hope I was successful. I utilized Adobe Illustrator and inDesign to produce the infographics. I am becoming versed in how to flex the power of these tools. For these infographics I only used the basic tools in each platform - nothing fancy. I think the most challenging and fun aspect of this project was in icon selection.

I'll choose to run through the questions backwards and start with the models. I'm learning, that I'm learning the formal names for many models that I've run through, which is neat. SAM and SAM2 are both useful. SAM2 adds a design iteration - which if I'm understanding correctly - provides a phase to prototype the project for the stakeholder, review, and make adjustments as needed creating a \"Design Proof\" before entering a development cycle and end product. This is useful for large projects with an invested stakeholder, but to much for this project. Source: However, the simpler SAM model, could be beneficial to producing a quick tested, tech dependent (Twine, Eko) product. Source: As noted earlier in the Design Process of this course, Backwards Design, layered with ADDIE would be what we would likely use and I see the process in Action Mapping only further supporting those models. For this project, there is now doubt in my mind, that Action Mapping will be useful model. At the very front, the model uses a SMART Goal to design around! Source: Moving on to Moore's Checklist , there are many great actionable items to check for. I will first list the things, from trainings, that drive me crazy when they are not present: People can prove that they already know material and skip it. Visuals are used to convey meaning. The writing is concise, uses contractions, and sounds like a magazine. Actionable items that I think would be fun to explore: Activity feedback shows people what happens as a result of their choice; they draw conclusions from the result. The format of the materials (webinar, PDF, etc.) is determined by the type of activities and users' needs. As for suggested rubric criteria, I think a measure of \"x\" action-oriented materials may be appropriate. I believe clearly stated Goals and Objectives are a must.

It was right there with Cool Math Games . in middle school computer labs. Mathematics instruction has always been Khan Academy's strong point. There were early discussion threads about how it \"failed\" and focused only on the process of solving problems, but it is the process that most students get lost in. As I taught Mathematics, for many years, I used the platform to brush up on skills. I found the videos useful in introducing topics in class or to extend independent learning. Today, Khan Academy also has online readings that follow the videos for students looking for text based explanations - supporting multiple modalities of learning. This is also true in the multiple question types that exit too. Further student supports are included in the \"hints\" which do sometimes appear to have multiple methods for solving problems. As with everything tech, sometimes new features take some time to develop and this has been my experience with the other subjects within Khan Academy. Additionally, even though not on the list, I played Legends of Learning , a gamification of Science concepts through role-playing and I played a variety of Social Studies games in iCivics . These are all neat approaches to learning. To some it wouldn't feel like \"real\" learning and are definitely aimed at younger learners. Learners may also have a hard time connecting to these games because they my not focus on what the learner may be desiring to learn. Each of the above, eLearning types, all require learner-agency and self-efficacy. The learner must be motivated to login to the platforms regularly, and persevere through the challenges. These are not the type of platforms where you visit once and gain all the information about any topic. In opposition, and as noted by @Brad, little learner-agency or self-efficacy is required for a \"Click and Quiz\" , especially for compliance training. Wouldn't learner-agency be completely removed ( as defined by compliance ) leaving only self-efficacy - or the motivation? From the list, I also clicked on The Game of College . and it instantly reminded me of playing [Oregon Trail]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(series) . back on the old Macintosh back in elementary school. These are almost subliminal learning, through choice. The only way to keep the learner engaged would be through great story telling and as @Nick said this story lacks wonder. I find it exciting to see this type of eLearning, storytelling, moving to video based story telling, e.g. Eko . And with that, my thoughts just jumped back up to compliance training, and how I've seen some instances of compliance training taking on this adaption of, choice, in the completion of the training.","title":"2020 09 15 INTE 5660 four types of elearning"},{"location":"Reflections/2020-09-21-INTE-5660-achieving-flow/","text":"What is Flow Theory 5-Factors of the flow state: Intrinsically rewarding Clear goals and a sense of progress Clear and immediate feedback Match of challenge and skill - agency Intense focus on present moment Learner support for flow state: Tap into intrinsic motivation: task they want to do vs have to do Embrace student choice (agency): allow them to own their learning Provide scaffolding: so student can choice the correct amount of challenge and skill (perceived ability) Minimize distractions: change pacing + more time Help students monitor their progress: set goals, analyze tasks, figure what to do, make adjustments, reflect on progress","title":"2020 09 21 INTE 5660 achieving flow"},{"location":"Reflections/2020-09-21-INTE-5660-intrinsic-elearning/","text":"I have been in undergrad classes, professional learning, and work-place meetings, when I entered the room with high motivation - but the content presentation was so poor that my mind wandered to more interesting things in the room. This experience was described in Allen\u2019s article pages 123,124 . Did I still want to learn the content, yes; did I take external measures to learn the content, yes. This is in agreement with Allen\u2019s second premise, page 124, \u201cIf motivation to learn is high, learning will occur even if instructional materials are poor and minimal assistance is available.\u201d Reflecting back on Moslow\u2019s Expanded Hierarchy of Needs , I would conclude that I had my basic needs (coping needs) fulfilled and I was being personally driven by my higher order needs, specifically cognitive needs - a desire to understand. Or as RSA Animates concludes, I am driven by purpose; I have a need to challenge myself, for mastery, and to contribute to a larger project. So how do we get our learner to learn and meet intended outcomes? Allens figure 9.1, shows learning (behavior changing) occurs at the point when they become interested and see value, and learning further increases when they are committed to improvement. Through Design Thinking, ARCS model , and Adult Learning Theory we could better engage with learners and increase motivation. All three approaches put the learner at the center, specifically keeping the information relevant and problem centered (scenario, real application, goal oriented) - intrinsic motivation. How do we get learners to want to learn via e-learning? This is the trick question! If the content is addressing the above, then the next factor to consider, through my experience, aesthetics. If it doesn\u2019t look new and modern, motivation will decrease exponentially. Also considering baseline accessibility needs, making it easy to see, hear, use, and understand, will also make eLearning more appealing.","title":"2020 09 21 INTE 5660 intrinsic elearning"},{"location":"Reflections/2020-09-30-INTE-5660-flow-state/","text":"I am a self-taught web developer. I had a personal desire to learn how to code, and all its complexities. It all began with research... and utilizing simple web tutorials where I received immediate feedback on my understanding. Once I had an understanding of the basics, I then became ambitious and entered into site development. I had a self-described goal for an end product. I knew how I wanted users to interact with the site, roughed out a design layout (storyboard), and had begun developing content. I chose to use a static site generator , saving on the complexity of learning server side technologies; I tried, but it was too complex for my ability at the time - see \" What is Flow Theory? \" as to why this disrupted my flow. A static site generator is a fairly simple idea, based on multiple templates, and inserts unformatted content into the template language using variables. The look comes from a separate CSS package which paints the website. The interactions come from a third package called javascript (JS). The static site generator reads all the files together into one website. Through trial and error - iterating - through possible template, HTML, CSS, and JS structures, I arrived at a satisfying end result. However, it was during the trial and error phase that I entered the flow state. Adjusting, rewriting, researching, problem-solving, was all a part of the flow-state. Every time I generated the site, I would have instant feedback on progress, find errors, then repeat the process on a new section of the site. Time would disappear. Is this aiming too high for eLearning, not at all. Is it easy to achieve, absolutely not. Through thoughtful design, I think it is possible to immerse a learner into the eLearning content - if the learner has the intrinsic motivation. As identified through non-linear design, building in exit points (branching) into areas for the learner to apply knowledge, having the learner share the experience or product produced, and then continuing on the learner path, may allow the learner to enter the flow state. I could almost say that I learned to code through a combination of eLearning (micro-learning) and project-based learning.","title":"2020 09 30 INTE 5660 flow state"},{"location":"Reflections/2020-10-04-INTE-5100-radical-design/","text":"After watching both Ted talks, I think CAEPA-ABLE Ambassador Leaders, my current design project, fits into Radical Design. I was thinking while watching The Unexpected Benefits of Celebrating Failures that the project definitely is not a moon-shot; however, it is reaching for the stratosphere - it is ambitious. The project has the potential to reach adult educators state-wide and as people talk, if successful, the project could be adopted into other states. In the second video, The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers , Adam Grant speaks of a missed opportunity with Warby and Parker, as they were late to the market. Later in the talk, Adam makes a claim that those first to market are not the most successful, it is those that iterate on the idea following the original creation who are more successful. This is the core of CAEPA-BLE Ambassador Leaders. The project itself is not an original idea; but rather, it is an original iteration of the idea. In fact, during our analysis phase, we identified learning problems/gaps that were correlated to the first release of Student Ambassadors. We found about half of adult educators in Colorado thought poorly of the current national Student Ambassadors program. We heard feedback that the model lacked support for those implementing the program and others felt the current design did not fit the needs of their program, therefore was inaccessible. So we iterated on the national model. Sure the idea was muddy at first, but as we thought through problems and gaps, the new design began to take shape. We moved the emphasis of the training off the topic of Student Ambassadors, to support that would be inclusive to all adult educators' needs and indirectly supporting the growth of Ambassadors. By adjusting the attention to topics that directly support educators, we will hopefully be driving participation and engagement in the program. This shift in focus is represented in the name as well, from Student Ambassadors to Ambassador Leaders. A lot of this began to come together during the Journey Map, shifting from analysis to design. In our map, we organized our phases to support the growth and (re)branding of the program. We discovered what professional learning topics would best support adult educators now, while also leaving flexibility in the design for the organization to assess and include new professional learning topics as needed. The national Student Ambassador program for adult education has not been declared dead, as Google X might have done. Rather, this project seeks to create a unique original program for Colorado while contributing to the larger national model.","title":"2020 10 04 INTE 5100 radical design"},{"location":"Reflections/2020-10-11-INTE-5660-michael-allen/","text":"CCAF & Interactive Instruction article challenge to think of how these puzzle pieces are included in my microlearning course.

So after reading the article, some things I was considering instructional interactivity, such as labeled graphic, are just clever content reveals. The same goes for a step carousel. This also makes me wonder if Rise Scenarios are instructional interactivity or if they just a question-answering activity (p. 260).

They are similar, in that they all attempt to create learning environments that are accessible to all. I think some of the confusion comes from their histories, and evolution over time. From my understanding, Universal design started out in architecture and Inclusive Design was brought about from the digital age. I\u2019ve even come across articles that point to differences in methods of design. Oregon State University describes that Universal Design for Learning starts from the outset of course creation - like architecture - thinking through the UDL Guidelines .

Laura typically speaks at Web Developer's conferences , and recently released a short video, Accessibility in 2020 , which addresses all three and then adds privacy and equity issues to the list. Maybe Laura is advocating for higher standards in the profession, see Disruptive Designs . Could it be that the definitions alter depending on the profession or part of the world you live in? Is it the keyword inclusion that blurs the lines? I think the \"how we UDL\" would be a valuable addition to the Learning Design and Technology course selection, as well as, the \"why we UDL\".

Working in Adult Education, programs also pulled together a Denver area cohort of stakeholders who would meet monthly at different service providers locations as a \u201cshow and tell\u201d and act like a union to discuss issues affecting programs.

I would say it is possible. Just placing content online, would most likely not be effective. This would go for any of the formats we initially discussed: MOOCs, Skill Classes, Click n Quiz, Simulations (Games). Through this course, we explored the many variables to consider: goals, objectives, motivation (intrinsic, extrinsic, Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs), as well as the CCAF model, and interactivities. Not to mention branching, and respecting the learner's background knowledge. With thoughtful design, creating effective Self-Paced Learning is possible. Again, I say possible because we need to recognize the learner and their motivation, as well as their agency and self-efficacy. If the learner is deficient in these areas, effective learning would be difficult in any environment. However, Self-Paced eLearning can be more accommodating to the learner's needs. Content can be introduced in a multitude of ways, and learning could be structured to meet the learner. To design in this way, would require a complete rethinking of the traditional learning materials/presentation and is most likely not done. I\u2019m thinking specifically of K-12 here. Perhaps a piece missing from the discussion is accountability. Who is holding the learner accountable? How does the learner receive feedback? Where is the help button when they have questions or need clarification? To a degree, these are resolved in agency and efficacy, but at some level, I think we like to collaborate with others in times of need and success and could be lacking in a Self-Paced eLearning. In an era where self-paced learning is abundant, thinking about bookstores and media (DIY, How-to, Self-help, pretty much everything), I think Self-Paced eLearning is just one piece of the puzzle to achieve effective learning.","title":"2020 12 13 INTE 5660 the course question"},{"location":"Reflections/2021-01-15-emotional-intelligence/","text":"I follow inc., an online business publication.

It must be 500 - 750 words in length and answer the following questions... What is the name of the app? Slack Who is the publisher/creator? Slack Technologies What platforms is the app available on? (Android, iOS, etc) Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web, Windows Provide a brief description of the application\u2019s functionality. Slack is a communication tool developed for teams. Slack offers persistent public chat rooms grouped by topic, private group chat rooms, and direct messaging. Chats may occur synchronously or asynchronous and provides a rich-text editor, with link summaries, mentions, and emoji support. What are your overall impressions? After installing Slack on multiple devices I found the application offers a similar experience across platforms. The web based app offers the most functionality, while the Android and iOS come close, there are some features removed. One such feature is the ability to remove the link preview. This is a minor feature removed, but can be distracting from the main message - especially when including multiple links. Outside of that, form factor is the only major change that I experienced. Slack also includes indicators to show who is active online and who has notifications disable - adding a layer of transparency to messaging - as well as indicators of how is actively typing a message. Both these small features are incredibly helpful in maintaining a conversation. Additionally, it is easy to see when new notifications arrive in the topic menu, including mentions or reactions. How usable did you find the application? I\u2019ve been using the application for about 7-weeks, and equally across devices. The Android and iOS application offer the same functionality and experience - so the only benefit from one to the other would be the form factor - tablet vs mobile, in my case. This mobile version works great for small group chats that are linear in nature, as Slack offers the ability to add replies to messages in the main thread. So, messaging can go two-layers deep - main and sub-thread. When navigating multiple topics, main and sub-threads, on tablet or mobile, it is easy to lose track of which chat thread you are in. It also can quickly become overwhelming if the group chat is active (synchronously) with more than two members. Messages are also limited to your skill in typing on the device. In cases where multiple team members are active, I found it necessary to switch to the desktop and use the web version. If only to see all the replies as they come in, and be able to use a keyboard to type longer responses. Another advantage to the desktop, is the ability to see the main thread and sub-threads at the same time. This is only possible because of the additional screen real estate that a desktop provides. Besides main and sub-threads, it is also possible to be in two topics at once, easing the ability to follow multiple discussions at once. Overall, Slack is a very usable chat application that allows the user to follow multiple topics and threads with ease. How could the app be used in an educational setting? In an education setting, the app could be used as a replacement to a standard discussion board. However, that would be limiting the application strength of real-time communication. This could easily be used in a synchronous online environment, substituting the live classroom to facilitate discussion. With Slack\u2019s ability to support private groups, it could also be used to form working groups for project based learning. Integrations are available, so expanding on the initial quality of the chat platform, integrations could provide additional opportunities for educational purposes. Incorporating polls, video platforms, or shared documents could provide a viable alternative to the traditional LMS. Any additional thoughts comments concerns? The login mechanism is odd and leaves a degree of confusion, at least for me. I never actually created a login or set a password. Instead I used something Slack calls auto-magically login. In essence, by submitting an email address sends a message with a login link. It works, but it's one of those things that you must retrieve the email on the same device that you are logging into, and that may not work seamlessly on a mobile or tablet, depending on what application you begin with. It also leaves the user feeling confused when reaching a login screen asking for a password, and one goes, \u201cI don\u2019t remember setting a password?\u201d Would you recommend the app? At the end of the day, Slack is a full featured mobile and desktop communication application and it is easy to see why it is popular. Yes, I would recommend Slack for those looking for a tool to assist with real-time team communication.","title":"Mobile Mayhem"},{"location":"Reflections/2021-03-15-accessability/","text":"Have you ever had a sticky door lock? You know the ones where no matter how hard you try to turn the key, it just won't turn.

We might have even gone for a pair of pliers or a wrench and ended breaking the key! I remember walking my sister through how to unlock my door when they were housesitting for me. The lock was so tight she thought I had given her the wrong key. Anyways, I follow many design blogs and came across an article about a simple redesign.

Media Literacy is the critical evaluation of the many aspects of media, including who published it and why they published it. Through analysis, it is possible to identify the intended audience and the meaning it may have intended to convey to them. We can also interpret, who wasn't included as audience and how the same message may be perceived by them. Understanding media helps to better understand and interpret the world we live in.

I think questions 3 & 4 from the 5 Key Questions of Media Literacy are the most difficult and yet most helpful. How might different people interpret this message? Which lifestyles, values, and points of view are represented -- or missing? Both of these questions ask the viewer to step back from self and apply understanding from others' points of view. When removing self from the interpretation, the options of interpretation become endless - as people are complex beings. When removing self, we are also opening ourselves up to misidentify others' experiences and observations of the media - apply stereotypes or other falsehoods.

We even produced various types of media, including infographics, advertisements, and other simple types of media. This naturally found its way into discussing racism, sexism, homophobia, and other prejudices, as the projects were based on Active Learning principles - creating a Participatory environment. As the instructor, I was also including media that intentionally exposed varying points of view. Having less experience in Elementary Education than I do with Middle & High School students, with the most experience in Adult Basic Education, I would be at a disadvantage to speak to what this might look like in younger students.
