      <p>I have been in undergrad classes, professional learning, and work-place meetings, when I entered the room with high motivation - but the content presentation was so poor that my mind wandered to more interesting things in the room. This experience was described in <a href="https://docdrop.org/pdf/Allen.Chpt09-fGJf4.pdf/">Allen’s article pages 123,124</a>. Did I still want to learn the content, yes; did I take external measures to learn the content, yes. This is in agreement with Allen’s second premise, page 124, “If motivation to learn is high, learning will occur even if instructional materials are poor and minimal assistance is available.”</p>

<p>Reflecting back on <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">Moslow’s Expanded Hierarchy of Needs</a>, I would conclude that I had my basic needs (coping needs) fulfilled and I was being personally driven by my higher order needs, specifically cognitive needs - a desire to understand. Or as <a href="https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc?t=833">RSA Animates</a> concludes, I am driven by purpose; I have a need to challenge myself, for mastery, and to contribute to a larger project.
So how do we get our learner to learn and meet intended outcomes? Allens figure 9.1, shows learning (behavior changing) occurs at the point when they become interested and see value, and learning further increases when they are committed to improvement.</p>

<p>Through Design Thinking, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ARCS_Model_Components_Table.jpg">ARCS model</a>, and <a href="https://cdn-infographic.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Adult-Learning-Theory-Andragogy-Infographic.jpg">Adult Learning Theory</a> we could better engage with learners and increase motivation. All three approaches put the learner at the center, specifically keeping the information relevant and problem centered (scenario, real application, goal oriented) - intrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>How do we get learners to want to learn via e-learning? This is the trick question! If the content is addressing the above, then the next factor to consider, through my experience, aesthetics. If it doesn’t look new and modern, motivation will decrease exponentially. Also considering baseline accessibility needs, making it easy to see, hear, use, and understand, will also make eLearning more appealing.</p>
