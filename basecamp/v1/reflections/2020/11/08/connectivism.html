      <p>Like others, my closest professional learning community were those on my team, colleagues. We would hold in-house professional learning weekly, during lunch. These could be as simple as a book group, others reporting out about things they have discovered elsewhere, or just conversations about what we are up to, the good, bad, and funny.</p>

<p>Working in Adult Education, programs also pulled together a Denver area cohort of stakeholders who would meet monthly at different service providers locations as a “show and tell” and act like a union to discuss issues affecting programs. This was one of a couple of local cohorts of program networks.</p>

<p>Now, these groups have mostly dissolved as almost all the programs participating have been defunded. I am one of many who are unemployed and adapting from the funding shift. However, I still find support from those I connected with. For now, I have chosen to focus on LDT Masters coursework - which I selected and applied to with support from my network - and continue volunteering.</p>

<p>Currently, I preside as president for the state association on Adult Education in Colorado (<a href="https://www.caepa.org/">CAEPA</a>), a volunteer-run organization. The organization supports professional learning. Interestingly, network and community are aspects that I am designing into a new program for the organization, in LDT 5100. I guess I am on a good path with that design!</p>

<p>As I am looking at a career shift, I am definitely looking to add to my network.</p>

<p>External networking suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have been attending the <a href="https://www.cu.edu/coltt">Colorado Learning and Teaching with Technology</a> (COLTT) conference for several years. Great professional learning and an opportunity to connect with professionals.</li>
  <li>I also find the <a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/">Cult of Pedagogy</a> a good resource with podcasts and articles about, well, pedagogy.</li>
  <li>If you are looking at building out a business, <a href="https://micasaresourcecenter.org/">Mi Casa Resource Center</a> is a great network to tap into.</li>
  <li>Of course, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-k-17111717">LinkedIn</a> can be a professional network, if used as one, and I do.</li>
  <li>I’m also bombarded with professional learning from all sorts of publishers and professional organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>eLearning in a pandemic is likely a worthy topic. Early on I saw an abundance of job postings to move training virtually, but I have been seeing fewer postings for this recently.</p>
