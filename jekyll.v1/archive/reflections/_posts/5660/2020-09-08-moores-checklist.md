Wowza, so much to think about!

I'll choose to run through the questions backwards and start with the models. I'm learning, that I'm learning the formal names for many models that I've run through, which is neat.

SAM and SAM2 are both useful.

SAM2 adds a design iteration - which if I'm understanding correctly - provides a phase to prototype the project for the stakeholder, review, and make adjustments as needed creating a "Design Proof" before entering a development cycle and end product. This is useful for large projects with an invested stakeholder, but to much for this project.

However, the simpler SAM model, could be beneficial to producing a quick tested, tech dependent (Twine, Eko) product.

As noted earlier in the Design Process of this course, Backwards Design, layered with ADDIE would be what we would likely use and I see the process in Action Mapping only further supporting those models.

For this project, there is now doubt in my mind, that Action Mapping will be useful model. At the very front, the model uses a SMART Goal to design around!

Moving on to [Moore's Checklist](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cathymooremedia/checklist-for-strong-learning-design-v2.pdf) , there are many great actionable items to check for. I will first list the things, from trainings, that drive me crazy when they are not present:

People can prove that they already know material and skip it.
Visuals are used to convey meaning.
The writing is concise, uses contractions, and sounds like a magazine.
Actionable items that I think would be fun to explore:

Activity feedback shows people what happens as a result of their choice; they draw conclusions from the result.
The format of the materials (webinar, PDF, etc.) is determined by the type of activities and users' needs.
As for suggested rubric criteria, I think a measure of "x" action-oriented materials may be appropriate. I believe clearly stated Goals and Objectives are a must.

As for length, my understanding is we are developing a micro-learning experience; however, the definition of "chunks" is ambiguous, we could define a minimum number of sections or lessons. Or we could look at length as in the time allotted for the learner to complete.

Both lengths could be viable requirement.
