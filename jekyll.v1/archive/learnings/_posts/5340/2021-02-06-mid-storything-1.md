## Assignment

Create an artifact that depicts a person, place or thing from the near-future.
\#audio, #video, #graphic-design, #animation

Requirements

-   Artifact should not make sense prior to the year 2021.
-   Artifact must tell a story, i.e. the item itself is a reflection of our society, or times, or our trajectory as a species.
-   Give us the backstory and artifact description with some detail. Why will this thing emerge and how will it impact?

## Backstory

Educational technology is striving to be more engaging and is finding itself mimicking many popular applications and software. This artifact attempted to play on the the idea of role playing games (RPG), Pok√©mon Go, chat rooms (social media), and live game streaming.

The emergence of the artifact - AR History - is a culmination of all these technologies. Augmented Reality (AR) is fairly new and unexplored learning technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being heavily explored - and dead people bots are not far off from becoming real.

The impact of an application that allows people to view the past as easily as they can follow popular trends may remind and connect us to our past.

## Process

I created this artifact using Adobe Premiere and Photoshop. The audio and video were captured using an iPhone 12 mini. Open source collections were used to gather additional media - historical photos and sound effects.

This project took between 10-15 hours. A large amount of time was spent in the ideation of the future artifact. I struggled with "how-to" tell the story. What persona do I take on? Do I come from it as a user, an advertisement, a reviewer... I landed on a future user, influencer, live-streamer. Collecting and recording media went smooth. I have used Adobe Creative Suite in the past, so the tools weren't entirely new - however, I did explore some new methods and became more proficient with the tools.

I'm happy the the artifact - and could have kept developing on it to fill in the holes int he story and fully develop all the ideas was was aiming for. This was "Hard Fun"
