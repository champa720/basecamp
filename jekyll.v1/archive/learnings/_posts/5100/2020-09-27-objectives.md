## Outline the problems/gaps

1.  Colorado adult educators have a mixed outlook, both positive and negative, of the national Student Ambassador model and are not aware of CAEPA’s vision for the new program.
2.  Colorado adult educators are curious about the effectiveness of the national adult education Student Ambassador model in other states and if it impacts students' engagement with programs.
3.  Colorado adult educators are not equipped to integrate standards-based content instruction and contextualized learning strategies.
4.  Colorado adult education programs and staff are not proficient with online or hybrid instruction and assessment strategies or techniques.
5.  Colorado adult education programs and staff are unfamiliar with online or hybrid engagement techniques and are concerned about student performance in these learning models.
6.  Colorado adult education programs are unstable due to lack of funding and resources; some also suffer from unsupportive work environments.

## Outline your potential solutions

1.  Develop a marketing campaign raising awareness of Ambassador Leaders vision (Problems/Gaps 1, 2)
2.  Develop a distance learning platform, offering both synchronous online sessions and self-directed modules, to support professional learning for  Colorado's adult educators and programs;
    2.  Create an inclusive environment by offering tiered training to meet the needs for beginning, intermediate, and advanced learners. (Problems/Gaps 3, 4, 5, 6)
3.  Develop forums for educators to discuss and extend knowledge forming a centralized hub supporting Ambassador Leaders & Growth. (All Problems/Gaps)
